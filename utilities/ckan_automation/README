Please note that before executing scripts which use CKAN API's, CKAN needs to be downloaded and installed in current working directory.

Execution format for statistics file:
python get_dataset_statistics.py <Dataset List File> <Output File>

Execution format for automation file:
python push_data_to_ckan.py <Dataset List File> <Ckan Url> <CKAN API Key>

In both cases above, please use "ecohd.csv" as Dataset List File.
