The outbreak was originally declared on 10 October 1996, with cases occurring in the region of Booue.  Measures were taken immediately to control the spread of infection both in the villages and hospitals with the assistance of a WHO team.  Health personnel received training and a public information campaign was launched.  It appeared initially that the outbreak was being brought under control.  However, at the beginning of December another outbreak occurred in the Booue region, causing 8 deaths.  Despite advice to the contrary, some contacts left the region and travelled to Lastourville, where one case was admitted to hospital, and to Libreville where two cases have died during the past week.  These cases in Libreville were children who accompanied their father to attend the burial ceremony of a deceased Ebola patient in Booue.   The Ministry of Health has made every effort to trace all persons who have been in contact with Ebola patients and to instruct the public on the imperative need to cooperate with the control efforts organized by the government.  The Ministry is now satisfied that all contacts have been traced and placed under medical supervision.  Seminars and training courses are being held for all personnel involved in the control operation, for which attendance is obligatory.   In Booue district, to date there have now been approximately 40 cases with 30 deaths since the start of the epidemic.  9 cases are presently convalescing.  In the past few days there have been 4 new cases with 1 death on 23 December.   The Ministry of Health and WHO are holding a press conference in Libreville today at 16h00 local time.  The press conference will be open to all interested journalists and is being held to provide full information to the public about the outbreak and the measures being taken to end it, and to reassure the public that the situation is fully under control.

Cholera has since been confirmed in all three holding centres in Kigoma town.   As at 4 December, 1 100 cases of presumed cholera had been detected (note: the case definition of presumed cholera is only  watery diarrhoea )  in the refugee population;  six were fatal - three among children under 10 years of age and three in patients over 60 years of age.  Six percent of the 1 100 presumed cases required IV rehydration. The population in the holding centres is estimated at 25 000.  The number fluctuates as refugees continue to arrive from Zaire and others are transferred from the holding centres to the camps.   Based on a total refugee population at risk the 1 100 cases detected correspond to a daily incidence of watery diarrhoea of 5-8 per 1 000.  Incidence of bloody diarrhoea is 2 to 3 per thousand per day.   Action taken: Improving water, sanitation and living conditions in all three Kigoma holding centres was the first priority.  Latrines have been built, water is now available almost continuously and trucks  are transporting people out of the holding centres to the camps at a rate of 1 000 persons per day, weather permitting.   Daily surveillance of diarrhoeal disease in all camps and holding centres by IRC, MSF and UNHCR is  coupled with active case-finding in the holding centres by community health workers.  MSF has set up an emergency treatment area in one of the holding centres for oral and IV rehydration and strict hygienic control of the cholera patients.  Nyarugusu Camp, which is receiving most of the refugees transferred out of the holding centres, is also ready to treat patients with cholera.  Ujiji Hospital,  which has a special diarrhoea ward, is being upgraded by MSF logistics. Wards are being rebuilt, electricity is brought in, extra latrines are under construction. Forty extra beds, in addition to the existing 10, will be made available this week.   Vibrio cholerae cultures obtained from both refugees and locals have been sent to the Tanzanian Reference Laboratory for confirmation, grouping and sensitivity testing. Supplies have also been ordered to allow the local laboratory technician  to work on identification and sensitivity testing of cholera strains, as well as shigella strains, should a shigella outbreak occurs.

Yellow fever:    All travellers arriving from countries known to be infected with yellow fever (as shown in the WHO Weekly Epidemiological Record) must present a valid yellow-fever vaccination certificate in accordance with the International Health Regulations.  In the absence of such a certificate, the person will be vaccinated upon arrival and placed under strict surveillance for 6 days from the day of vaccination or the last date of potential exposure to infection - whichever is earlier.  Health offices available at entry points will be responsible for notifying the appropriate Director General of Health Affairs, in the region or governorate, about the place of residence of the visitor.    Aeroplanes and other means of transportation arriving from areas infected with yellow fever are requested to submit a certificate indicating disinsection in line with the International Health Regulations.   II.    Meningococcal meningitis   For all arrivals.  Visitors from all over the world arriving for the purpose of  Umra  or pilgrimage or for seasonal work are requested to produce a certificate of vaccination against meningitis issued not more than 3 years and less than 10 days before arrival in Saudi Arabia.  The responsible authorities in the country from where the visitor comes must ensure that vaccination has been carried out as follows:   Adults and children over the age of 2 years must be given one dose of the A/C vaccine Children between 3 months and 2 years of age must be given two doses of the A vaccine with a 3-month interval between the two doses.      Arrivals from countries in the African meningitis belt.   It must be ensured that all visitors from these countries have been vaccinated in their countries, not more than 3 years and not less than 10 days before arrival. This should be documented on the vaccination certificate.   Visitors from these countries will be checked at entry points to ensure that they are vaccinated. Suspect cases, shall be isolated and preventive measures will be taken in respect of their direct contacts. If the authenticity of the vaccination certificate is felt to be questionable, revaccination is to be carried out.   Chemoprophylaxis will be administered to all visitors from these countries to lower the carrier rate among them.   III.    Diphtheria   Visitors arriving for pilgrimage or  Umra  purposes from the countries of the former USSR are requested to present a certificate indicating diphtheria vaccination.  They will also be given one does of benzathene penicillin as follows:   600 000 units for persons weighing less than 30 kg; 1 200 000 units for adults and children weighing more than 30 kg.   Those allergic to penicillin should, instead, be given erythromycin, as follows:   adults: 1 g daily (divided equally into four doses) for one week; children: 40 mg per kg body weight, daily (divided equally into four doses) for one week.   For all the above, certificates should be issued either in Arabic, English or French;  in addition, a copy in the official language of the country of origin may be enclosed.   IV.   Epidemiological surveillance   Tight control is exercised on entry points in respect of pilgrims and  Umra  visitors, and thorough surveillance shall be made in respect of visitors coming from countries infected with diseases subject to the International Health Regulations, in addition to isolation of suspect cases and surveillance of their contacts.   V.    Foods   Foods carried by visitors and pilgrims are banned and not allowed into the country.  Special rules apply for foods imported for commercial purposes.

"1996","http://www.who.int/csr/don/1996_11_28c/en/index.html"," 1996 - Rwanda repatriation movement   28 November 1996  Disease Outbreak Reported   Summary:   From 15 to 21 November 1996 an estimated 500 000 refugees returned from East Zaire to Rwanda across the border at Gisenyi, a small Rwandese town next to the Zairian town of Goma.  More than 90% of them crossed the border during the first three days.  The massive and rapid influx of returnees occurred on an unexpectedly large scale and could have had very serious public health consequences.  About 14 000 consultations and 47 deaths were registered by the epidemiological sentinel stations in place.  Diarrhoeal diseases accounted for two-thirds of all consultations. The crude mortality rate was estimated to 0.1/ 10 000/day (based on a denominator of 500 000).  In view of the potential risks associated with such a massive population movement, this figure can be considered a success.   The first groups of returnees arrived in Goma on 15 November 1996.  They were held in the Petite Barrière camp and released to relieve the pressure created by a massive influx of new arrivals.   Way stations  were installed every 5 to 6 km on the route according to a preestablished plan as soon as these arrivals were announced.  Water, protein biscuits and some basic care, essentially oral and intravenous rehydration, were provided.  Two transit centres were opened for further health care.  Local health centres were also contributing, particularly those along the route of the returnees.  Food distribution was limited to protein biscuits since any slowdown could have caused panic and stampedes,  and would also worsen the risk of epidemics.   Epidemiological surveillance   Simple and practical forms for surveillance were developed mainly to detect illness with epidemic potential.  The forms were distributed in advance to health centres concerned and to non-governmental organizations involved health care and working in the Gisenyi Prefecture.   Medical coordination was established in the regional health directorate under the chairmanship of the medical director of the health region concerned with technical support of the representative from WHO on site.  Members of the health directorate, medical representatives of the UN agencies and NGOs involved met formally on a daily basis.   The epidemiological information presented below was collected in the  way stations  on the transit route, the transit centres and local health units.  The NGOs such as AHA, COOPI, Merlin, MDM and MSF provided epidemiological data collected in the districts they had been allocated.   Crude morbidity and mortality rates were calculated on a denominator of 500 000 population although the exact number is not known.   In addition to medical coordination and data collection, a plan of action in the event of a cholera epidemic was established with the health authorities.   Results:   A total of 14 160 consultations were registered from 16 to 21 November 1995.  The peak of the consultations was on the third day of the migration.  On this day, almost all returnees were still within the District of Gisenyi.  Acute diarrhoeal disease was the main complaint and amounted to 9,407 or 66% of all registered consultations.  The peak of the consultations for diarrhoea also occurred on the third day of the migration and then decreased (see table 1).   Only 319 cases of bloody diarrhoea were reported, with no deaths.   In 23 cases of watery diarrhoea, Vibrio cholerae 01 El Tor was isolated from faecal samples by the laboratory in the central hospital in Kigali.  None of the confirmed cases of cholera was severe or needed antibiotic treatment.  This was fortunate as the V.cholerae strains isolated were resistant to doxycycline, tretracyline and cotrimoxazole.  There were 38 deaths from diarrhoeal disease (CFR=0.4%).   One case of measles and a case of suspected meningitis were registered.   It seems likely that many patients who consulted for acute diarrhoea were in reality exhausted and dehydrated after their long and sustained effort.  Many presented with vomiting and stomach cramp and many complained of muscular cramp.  No blood tests were done to investigate but it seems likely they suffered from hypoglycaemia and hypokalaemia.  The  patients recovered after receiving perfusion (Ringer's lactate) and a few protein biscuits and could continue their route.   Comment   The public health indicators are surprisingly good considering the massive repatriation taking place in a short time.  A crude mortality rate of 0.1 per 10,000/day compares well with the mortality rate of 0.3/10 000/day estimated in the Mugunga camp where the refugee population stayed earlier.   However, further steps need to be taken to strengthen preparedness in case of future massive population movements.   This is particularly true if the health status of the population concerned continues to be precarious.   The lessons learnt have served as a basis for recommendations for the future.  "

No additional cases of Ebola fever have been confirmed but monitoring will continue at a meticulous level until the last contact clears the 21-day incubation period.  The nurse who became infected while caring for an Ebola patient from Gabon is still in a serious but stable condition.   All contacts undergo twice-daily checks at the hospitals where they are employed. This includes taking of temperatures and checking by a health worker.  A contact with raised temperature who reports a headache or feeling generally unwell will be referred for clinical examination and blood test.

The illness started with mild fever on 2 November and progressed to severe headache on 6 November when she was admitted to hospital with suspected encephalitis.  No evidence of encephalitis was found in cerebrospinal fluid.  The patient developed a fine rash and diarrhoea and platelet count which had been low on admission continued to fall.  This was accompanied by marked leukopenia and abnormal liver enzyme tests.   Immunofluorescence test of serum was negative for Ebola virus and a range of other haemorrhagic fever viruses on 9 November.

Of these 297 (4%) have died.   Dengue type 2 has been isolated from five cases by the All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi and the National Institute of Virology, Pune.   As there is no commercially available vaccine to prevent dengue, protection from mosquito bites is of utmost importance.  Covering exposed areas of the body with insect repellent and sleeping under bed nets is effective personal protection against infection, while long-term protection can be accomplished by eliminating the mosquito breeding sites which are small collections of water in objects such as broken bottles, standing water, and even plants which collect and contain rain water such as the curled leaves of a banana tree.   A fact sheet on dengue and dengue haemorrhagic fever gives further information and advice.  "

The information below is based on a report by Spanish health authorities. Travellers are recommended to consult with their local physician for advice if  necessary .   Deaths from suspected meningococcal infection have been reported in two children visiting Mallorca in May.  The first was in a 13 year-old who arrived from the United Kingdom on 18 May, had onset of illness the day after and died 20 May.  The second death occurred in an 11 year-old tourist from Germany who arrived 17 May, had onset of clinical illness on 21 May, and died 22 May.  They stayed in the same hotel.  Pending etiological confirmation, close case contacts are receiving chemoprophylaxis.   Meningococcal infection has been reported in two other tourists from the United Kingdom staying at different hotels and without a history of contact with each other or the two fatal cases.  One was a 5-years-old girl who arrived in Mallorca on 14 May, with onset of illness on 23 May and hospitalized the following day.  She was still in hospital on 28 May. Neisseria  meningitidis group C has been identified as the infectious agent.  Case contacts have received chemoprophylaxis and have been recommended vaccination.  The second confirmed case was in a 3-year-old boy who arrived in Mallorca on 4 May, and hospitalized since 17 May.   The reported incidence of meningococcal infection in the Balearic Isles was low for the first 13 weeks of 1996 with a total of 4 notified cases against an average of 10 cases for the same period in the preceding five years.  Identification of the serogroup and serotype of these cases is underway.   Comment: Meningococcal disease is contagious and caused by the meningococcus N. meningitidis which is transmitted through direct contact with an infected person, including respiratory droplets from nose and throat.   The infection persists in the community by healthy carriers.  Of the two clinical forms of meningococcal disease, meningococcal meningitis is the more common while meningococcal septicaemia is less common but more often fatal.   In view of the often rapid clinical progression of meningococcal disease, early treatment of suspected cases with antibiotics is recommended.  Chemoprophylaxis should be offered to close contacts of the index case.  Surveillance of household and other close contacts for early signs of illness, especially fever, is necessary to initiate appropriate therapy without delay. Meningococcal vaccines that protect against serogroups A, C, W135 and Y are available.  "

Following reports on outbreaks in neighbouring countries, the health authorities implemented a preparedness strategy of strengthened surveillance, public health information campaigns and  distribution of 20 000 doses vaccines and drugs to each of the 8 regions in December 1995.  In the strengthened surveillance system, each local health centre provides weekly reports to peripheral health centres for forwarding on to the regional and central health authorities.  Most district health centres have radio communication links with the peripheral health services.   Since 15 March 1996 the national health authorities have allocated 200 million CFA for vaccine and field operations and have ordered 1 million doses of vaccine and other material needed for the campaign.

One animal was dead and the other sick when sampled.  The monkeys had been imported from the Philippines.  At present there is no indication of associated human disease.  A team from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is conducting further investigations on site.   Reston virus was first discovered in 1989 in monkeys imported from the Philippines which had died in a holding facility in Reston, Virginia, just outside Washington, D.C. , USA. While monkeys suffer a severe disease often leading to death, the limited information available indicates that humans may not become clinically ill.  However, this is based only on the isolation of Reston virus from one asymptomatically infected animal handler identified during the original outbreak and a few seroconversions that were not associated with clinical disease.   A formal quarantine procedure for imported monkeys was developed following the original Reston episode and it is this system that apparently identified the current cases.  "

The disease in these cases differs from classical CJD in several respects:   early age (CJD is usually a disease of older people) differences in pathological changes in the brain absence of any hereditary factors (which are involved in typical CJD) There is no direct evidence of a link between these cases and bovine spongiform encephalitis (BSE).  However, in the absence of any apparent cause, the most likely explanation at present is that these cases are linked to exposure to BSE before control measures were instituted in the UK in 1989.  The measures now in force in the UK are considered to have minimized any possible risk from eating beef.   No similar pattern of disease has been recognized in humans in any other country although BSE has also occurred in animals in Ireland, France, Portugal, and Switzerland.  Precautions have been taken in these countries to avoid any possible risk to people from beef consumption.   WHO recommends that national health authorities be notified if any unusual occurrence of CJD is recognized in any other country.  "

Types B and C have increased during this period and in 1995 when  48% of cases were serotyped, 42% were type B and 57% type C.   Ampicillin and penicillin has been recommended for treatment of cases, rifampicin for prophylaxis in close contacts.  Several vaccination campaigns have been conducted in the state, In December 1994- February 1995, 63% of children in age groups from 6 months to 13 years.  Over 80% in age groups between 1 and 9 years received the vaccine.  The vaccination campaign was resumed in November 1995 targeting the age groups 14-29 years.  "

Cases have recently been detected in two rural health centres close to Bujumbura, Maramvya and Gatumba.  Efforts to provide medical supplies and safe water to rural areas have probably succeeded in decreasing the inflow of cases to the hospital in Bujumbura. The rural health centre in Marmvya has received MSF support and UNICEF has provided water to five camps around the health centre. Gatumba health facility received from a visiting WHO team an emergency stock for treatment of the severe cases of dehydration but the centre lacks water and only a limited number of cases can be treated. Information is not available from other health centres around Bujumbura where the current security situation prevent visits by health teams.  The epidemic appears to be under control but the preacarious security situation and potential massive population displacements contribute to a continued threat of new outbreaks.  "

It included representatives of the national government, Centres for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, Communicable Disease Surveillance Centre, London, Epicentre, Paris and European Programme for Intervention Epidemiology Training, Brussels and WHO geneva and Kinshasa.   The team identified 419 suspect cases fitting the case definition of a possible or probable case, which, together with those identified in previous surveys, amounts to a total of 511 suspect cases of human monkeypox reported since February 1997.  The highest number of suspect cases were in outbreaks in Akungula in August 1997, in Ekanga and neighbouring villages in March 1997 and several other villages in August 1997.   Of the 419 suspect cases identified by the team in October 1997, 344 occurred in the Katako Kombe health zone and 75 in the Lodja health zone. Fourteen of them had active disease.  Most (85%) of the 344 suspect cases resident in the Katako-Kombe zone were in children under 16 years of age.  Thirty-one per cent had had moderate or severe rash, i.e. more than 100 skin lesions, and in 41% the eruption lasted longer than one week.  Fever, diarrhoea, cervical lympadenopathy, sore throat and mouth ulcers were the most common symptoms.  Ten were hospitalised for up to 30 days and 54% were incapacitated for more than three days. Five died (case fatality ratio 1.5%). These individuals ranged in age from four to eight years and all died within three weeks of rash onset.  Twenty had scar evidence of vaccinia vaccination and 19 reported a past history of chicken pox.   Twenty-two per cent of the 419 suspect cases identified during this mission were primary, the remainder were defined as secondary. Of these secondary cases, 48% reported contact with another suspect case in the compound, 42% in the household and 53% in the neighbourhood (some had more than one contact). Primary cases with no apparent connection to Akungula and Ekanga villages, were reported from 49 of the total 78 villages where cases were found. Thirty-five per cent of the 419 cases reported being outside their home village in the three weeks before disease onset - the majority in the forest.   This outbreak represents the largest ever reported cluster of suspect cases  spread over a large area of the Katako-Kombe and Lodja zones.  The clinical disease was milder but household secondary attack rate was higher than previously documented, possibly due to an increased number of susceptible individuals after the cessation of vaccinia vaccination, rather than increased person to person transmission. Some of the serum specimens obtained from suspect cases have been positive for varicella, and final analysis will take this into account.   Transmission seems to have now ceased at the original epicentre of the outbreak and the immediate surrounding villages. The more recently detected suspect human cases occurred in more geographically distant clusters, the majority with no apparent link to the original outbreak. These suspect cases of sporadic transmission may be due to independent introductions of virus into the human population through increased animal contact.   Results of the final analysis will be published simultaneously when laboratory results are available in Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report , the EuroSurveillance Bulletin and the Weekly Epidemiological Record .

The deceased was identified by the hospital authorities as a 37-year male who had apparently arrived in Germany on a Ghana Airways flight.   The Ministry of Health, Ghana assured the Ghanaian Embassy that no case of Lassa fever had been reported in Ghana and thus the patient could not have been infected in Ghana.  The Ministry of Health recommended that the origin of the patient be verified since  his name did not sound Ghanaian nor did his supposed arrival via Ghana Airways mean that he had recently stayed in Ghana.   On 26 September the Mainz hospital authorities called a press conference and announced that tests conducted at the Tropical Disease Institute at the Bernhard Nocht Institute, Hamburg  had dismissed Lassa fever as the cause of death of the man.   The press release was issued to assure Ghanaians and all visitors to Ghana that Lassa fever has never been detected in Ghana.  Ever since the detection of the cases of Lassa fever in Nigeria, Ghanaian clinicians have been particular about examining cases of fever with haemorrhagic tendencies thoroughly.  In addition  the Noguchi Memorial Institute for Medical Research at the University of Ghana has often been called upon to support  the national laboratory network in this work.   The Ministry of Health is confident that their disease surveillance system is very active and should a case of Lassa fever or any other unusual disease appear in the country it will be detected and contained.

Facing the possibility of further spread of HPS, the ministers of health of all countries in the Americas joined in a resolution to intensify the surveillance of, and fight against, hantavirus infection during the Directing Council of the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) in September 1997.   A total of 350-400 HPS cases have been confirmed in the Americas, most of them in Argentina and the USA. About 45% of the reported cases were fatal. The high fatality rate is associated with the sudden onset of pulmonary oedema and respiratory distress. There is no specific treatment for HPS, although prompt diagnosis is important for appropriate management of respiratory distress.   HPS is caused by several distinct hantaviruses which are each  associated with a specific rodent host. Once infected, rodents shed the virus throughout their lifetime. Humans are infected by inhaling aerosols of fresh or dried rodent excreta (faeces, urine and saliva). Investigation of an epidemic in Argentina in 1995 provided strong evidence for person-to-person transmission, not observed in studies in the USA.  In any event, strict barrier nursing techniques are now recommended for management of suspected or confirmed cases.   Control measures in endemic areas focus on rodent control with particular emphasis on excluding rodents from buildings and reducing suitable habitats around inhabited dwellings.  Many infections have resulted from cleaning rodent-infested areas. The use of readily available disinfectants such as chlorine bleach is recommended to decontaminate potentially infectious droppings and debris prior to cleaning. If available, respiratory protection should be used during this high risk activity.   Improved laboratory diagnostic capacity in endemic areas is important for prompt recognition of HPS cases. Furthermore, identification of the rodent reservoir of each hantavirus is important to detect potential HPS endemic regions and to understand the risk of rodent-human interaction.

Based on previous epidemiological patterns, it is expected that the outbreak will peak in the next few weeks. The WHO Collaborating Centre has alerted clinicians to the possibility of these unusual presentations and to monitor their patients closely.   The whole nation has been put on the alert and aggressive integrated control programmes have been taken by the respective ministries and agencies.

During the period March to May 1997, 170 cases suspected to be monkeypox were reported: 58 in March, 52 in April and 60 in May.  There were no deaths. Most (134/170) cases were in children under 16 years of age. Katako-Kombe, where the outbreak was first registered in 1997, accounted for 112 of the cases which occurred during March, April and May 1997.  The remaining 58 cases occurred in neighbouring Lodja Nord (47 cases) and Lodja Sud (11 cases).   Cases of poxvirus-like illness were also observed in Kinshasa in January/February 1997.   Laboratory investigations have confirmed infection with an orthopoxvirus in this outbreak.  The WHO epidemiologist who originally investigated the suspect cases of monkeypox in Kinshasa has recently returned to the area and reported that no further human-to-human transmission has occurred since his last visit there in March.   Comment: A possible reason for the increased occurrence of monkeypox could be the growing proportion of the population which has not received the vaccinia vaccine which was used to protect against smallpox until that disease was eradicated.   It has been suggested that vaccinia vaccine be given to protect the population at risk of monkeypox. Such a recommendation requires careful evaluation in view of the high risk of adverse effects of vaccinia vaccine, particularly in a population which may be immunocompromised due to HIV infection.  To further study the cause of the outbreak and recommend protective measures,  WHO, its partners from Collaborating Centres, and the Ministry of Health of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (former Zaire) initiated a joint investigation in February 1997.   In view of the unstable political and social situation in the country, the team had to be evacuated after 10 days before sufficient information could be collected to make complete recommendations.  WHO is now planning to reestablish the team to resume the investigations in September 1997.  "

Most cases were in children in the age group 2-5 years with, in general, mild symptoms, few complications and no deaths.  The increase was detected through the strengthened preparedness for infectious diseases prevention and control set up by the health authorities in accordance with WHO recommendations in which all cases of suspected meningitis are notified and investigated in the laboratory.   During January-May 1997 a total of 180 cases of meningitis were reported compared with 121 during the same period in 1997.  The increase in 1997 was particularly marked in the fourth week of May in the northern part of the Gaza Strip.  Bacterial meningitis was confirmed in 54 cases, mainly associated with Neisseria meningitidis but also Haemophilus influenzae , Streptococcus pneumoniae and other bacteria.

On 14 April 1997, a 19-month old boy was admitted to the Sibu Hospital Sibu, Sarawak, Malaysia, with a 3-day history of fever and oral ulcers.  On examination, he showed poor peripheral perfusion and tachycardia, subsequently developed cardiac failure, and died on 15 April 1997.  Since then, 26 more children in several cities in Sarawak have died of heart failure, and 2 others who were brought in dead are suspected to have died of similar cause.  Eighteen (62%) of the 29 children were male.  Their mean age was 1.6 years (range 7 months to 6 years); 23 (79.3%) of 29 were less than 2 years old.   The 27 children who were admitted alive presented with or soon thereafter developed signs of shock, including pallor, cold extremities, delayed capillary refill, and weak peripheral pulses.  Pulmonary oedema was present in many cases; intravenous fluids often exacerbated the oedema.  Nearly all the children had sinus tachycardia on electrocardiogram; no rhythm disturbances were noted.  Echocardiograms obtained on most patients uniformly showed a poorly contractile globular left ventricle with low output (ejection fraction <60%).  In most instances, children died within 7 days of onset of illness, and death usually ensued within 24 hours of admission.  Postmortem examinations have been performed on 3 children; results are pending.  The most recent fatal case to date had onset on 21 June 1997 and died on 24 June 1997.   Many of these children had a maculopapular or vesicular rash on the palms or soles and vesicles or ulcers in the oral cavity, characteristic of hand, foot, and mouth disease.  Several children had signs of central nervous system infection [3 (15%) of 20 had acute flaccid paralysis, and 9 (45%) of 20 had histories of seizures].  Examination of the cerebrospinal fluid showed a lymphocytosis, consistent with viral meningitis.  In several cases, family members reported that the children who died had been in contact with other children with hand, foot, and mouth disease two to five days prior to onset of their own illness.   Since April 1997, private practitioners in Sarawak have reported seeing a large number of children with hand, foot and mouth disease, who presented with fever, mouth ulcers and maculopapular or vesicular rash on the palms and soles.  Since 6 June 1997, private physicians and government clinics have reported 2 113 cases of hand, foot, and mouth disease in young children in Sarawak (population 1.9 million).   During June 1997, almost 2140 children with hand, foot and mouth disease have been admitted to private or government hospitals in peninsular Malaysia (population 21 million).  No fatalities have yet ben reported among those children hospitalized.   Update 30 June: The Sarawak Health Department informed of an additional fatal case in a 2-year-old boy from Sarikei Division who died from viral myocarditis in Sarawak General Hospital on 30 June.  Update posted on the web site of Sarawak Health Department  at http://www.jaring.my/jkns/outbreak/virus1.htm   Epidemiological and laboratory investigations are underway.

Three of the 21 deaths occurred in the second half of April, 10 during May and the remaining 8 occurred in June.  Most children had fever for  2-3 days and were admitted to hospital when their condition deteriorated.  The clinical picture indicated viral involvement with coxsackie virus as a possible agent.  Coxsackie virus was also suspected in a concurrent outbreak of hand, foot, and mouth disease in Sibu.    Antibody to coxsackie B virus has been detected in specimens taken from four children who had died of viral myocarditis and three who had hand, foot and mouth disease.  The laboratory results were from a team of clinical virologists and scientists at the Institute for Medical Research, Malaysia.   Coxsackie virus is mainly transmitted by the oral-faecal route and the public has been advised to maintain good personal hygiene, hand washing after defaecation and before handling food, avoid sharing baby pacifiers, avoid overcrowding.  Public health measures include increased control of flies and cockroaches, and closures of nurseries, playschools, kindergartens and public swimming pools in Kuching and Sibu where most deaths have occurred.

The cases were from Sibu, Sarikei and Kuching Divisions at the western end of Sarawak with most cases coming from Sibu.  The clinical condition as described by the Sarawak Health Department comprises  fever of 2-3 days duration, nervous system involvement manifested as seizures and unilateral paralysis of one side of the upper limbs, poor systemic perfusion and at the end stage cardiogenic shock due to myocarditis with echocardiogram showing decreased contractability of left ventricle. The presence in some cases of pulmonary oedema and/or exanthema and lesions of the buccal mucosa and the palms could suggest the diagnosis of foot and mouth disease as a possibility but this awaits laboratory confirmation (coxsackie virus investigations are under way).   A variety of diagnostic specimens, including stools, respiratory swabs and cerebrospinal fluid, are being investigated at the University of Malaya and serological specimens at the Institute of Medical Research in Kuala Lumpur.

From January to  19 April 1997, 799 cases with 148 deaths (CFR 18.5%) were reported.  In the endemic Lassa fever situation an annual average of 40-50 cases normally occurred in this region.  An elevated number of Lassa fever cases has continued to occur in 1997  with 45 cases reported in January, 75 in February and 147 in March.   The increased occurrence is closely related to massive population movements with subsequent crowding, poor sanitation, unsafe food handling and storage practices combined with an increase in the rat population.  Furthermore, with the improving political and security situation in Sierra Leone,  the populace is moving about more freely to access health care facilities resulting in increased case reporting.   The Ministry of Health, WHO, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, USA and MERLIN, United Kingdom have worked together to monitor the outbreak and to mitigate its impact.  Patients are brought to and treated at an isolation ward established in Kenema which has been expanded to accommodate the increase in cases.  Several workshops have been held to train health staff and to educate the general public about measures to avoid contact with rodents.  Supplies of ribavirin, the antiviral drug used to treat Lassa virus infections, were nearly depleted.  The Red Cross was contacted regarding this need and the Chinese Red Cross responded with a donation of 120,000 doses of the drug to the Government of Sierra Leone.   WHO is working with the pharmaceutical industry on a long-term solution..   (Based on a report from WHO representative in Sierra Leone.)   Comment: Transmission of the Lassa virus in the community is mainly due to contact with rats of the genus Mastomys.  Infected rats continually shed viruses in their urine and humans are infected by ingestion of food contaminated with  rat urine or inhalation of  virus-containing aerosols.  Minimizing contact with rodents by the safe handling and storage of food or restricting access of rats to homes, remains therefore the most effective preventive measure.  Person-to-person transmission occurs primarily in health care institutions caring for Lassa patients.  Nosocomial spread can easily be prevented by managing patients in isolation wards and with appropriate protective measures (barrier nursing).  The risk of transmission during international travel is low unless the traveller is in contact with a severely ill and bleeding case.  A recent incident involving a virus which causes a similar clinial syndrome occurred in South Africa where a nurse was infected with Ebola virus while caring for a patient from an endemic area.  This underscores the importance of health care staff awareness and use of special precautions when treating  patients who have travelled abroad.  "

Monkeypox is a rare viral disease with a clinical presentation similar to smallpox.  It is largely limited to populations who come into contact with animals which harbour the monkeypox virus in remote areas of the tropical rainforest in Africa.   As mentioned in the article in Weekly Epidemiological Record No.15 published 11 April 1997, the current measures undertaken to interrupt disease transmission include education of health-care providers and distribution of health messages, such as limiting contact with wild-caught animals and restricting contact with suspected cases to a single person (preferably the oldest member of the household who has either recovered from monkeypox or has a  vaccinia  vaccination scar).   Further WHO studies are planned in the region to determine the need for additional risk-reduction measures.  "

A WHO consultant who was already in Mogadishu to study cholera transmission there and to assist in setting up a cholera committee   will now extend his stay to help deal with the increasing number of cases there.  However, in recently affected rural areas coordination of control activities is difficult.   Based on trends of cholera outbreaks in previous years, a decline in numbers is expected in the next six to eight weeks.  The remote areas affected will continue to be difficult to reach  because of  insecurity and logistical constraints.   Cholera task forces meet regularly to review the situation.  "

"1997","http://www.who.int/csr/don/1997_04_14/en/index.html"," 1997 - Monkeypox changes its pattern of human infection   14 April 1997  Disease Outbreak Reported   Following reports of ongoing cases of human monkeypox in Zaire representing a new pattern of the disease, the Ministry of Health in Zaire and the World Health Organization (WHO) organized an investigation in February 1997.   Monkeypox, a disease which closely resembles smallpox, is preventable by the vaccination against smallpox.   The study revealed that  this outbreak represents the largest cluster of monkeypox cases ever reported, and the proportion of patients that were 15 years of age or older (27%) was higher than previously reported (8%).  Young children have been most affected in previous outbreaks.   These findings contradict previously accepted findings on the nature of the disease.   Studies over a twenty year period have shown that the rate of transmission of monkeypox within households was low, suggesting that the disease had a low potential for transmission from person to person and that an outbreak could not last long after the first patients recovered.  However, the recent study has shown that active cases in February 1997 were linked to cases that occurred during the preceding 12 month period.  The study also revealed the following:   The rate of transmission from person to person (73%) was higher than previously reported (30%).  This was associated with the clustering of cases in household compounds and prolonged chains of transmission from person to person.   The proportion of deaths (3%) was lower than previously reported (10%).   Monkeypox disease closely resembles ordinary forms of smallpox.  The viruses causing the two diseases are related and vaccination against smallpox also protects against monkeypox.  The emergence of monkeypox does not mean that smallpox, which has been eradicated, is re-emerging.   All age groups are affected, but children who have not been vaccinated are at the highest risk of death, about a 10% case fatality rate.  Most cases occur in remote villages of Central and West Africa close to tropical rainforests where there is frequent contact with infected animals. Monkeypox is usually transmitted to humans from squirrels and  primates.   In the past, an outbreak of monkeypox would not go very far in the village or last long because it did not spread extensively after the first patients recovered.  However, what concerns WHO is that the present study indicates that monkeypox disease is changing its pattern of infection in humans.  This outbreak has a much higher rate of person-to-person transmission than seen before, and spread through many generations of transmission, thus maintaining the outbreak for more than a year.   The ending of vaccination programmes against smallpox in the late 1970's has probably led to an increase in susceptibility to monkeypox and could explain the larger size of the outbreak, the higher proportion of patients aged 15 and over, and the spread through many generations of transmission.   The changing nature of monkeypox disease is of concern to WHO.  In the past, before the eradication of smallpox in 1980, smallpox vaccination was widespread and protected against both smallpox and monkeypox.  Since the eradication of smallpox, vaccination programmes have been discontinued as recommended by WHO and WHO  is concerned that monkeypox could pose a localized public health problem. WHO will therefore continue to maintain vigilance by strengthening detection systems for monkeypox and completely investigating future outbreaks so that the best strategy for prevention and control may be developed.   Articles describing the investigation will simultaneously appear on 11April 1997, in the WHO Weekly Epidemiological Record , in the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report , and in the next edition of Eurosurveillance. In addition to WHO the study partners were  from: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Institut national de Recherche biomédicale, Kinshasa; Ecole de Santé publique, Kinshasa; the European Programme for Intervention Epidemiology Training (EPIET), Brussels; and Médicins Sans Frontières.

There is increasing concern about the extent to which bacteria pathogenic in humans have acquired resistance to antimicrobial drugs.  Use of antimicrobial drugs in food animals is  known as potentially adding to the development of antimicrobial  resistance in bacteria of medical relevance. However, the real scope of the medical impact of the use antimicrobials in livestock  production is generally unknown.   WHO intends to organize a scientific consultation on the medical  impact of use of antimicrobial drugs in food animals in October 1997  in Berlin. The objectives of the consultation are:   to review the knowledge of the medical risks regarding  antimicrobial resistance in bacteria of public health significance  associated with the use of different antimicrobial drugs in food  animal production   in the context of the development of the WHO Network on Antimicrobial Resistance Monitoring to define the needs on monitoring  of emergence, mechanisms of development and spread to man of   antimicrobial resistance in food and animals at national and  international levels   to obtain an international consensus on how to tackle the  identified problems.

An estimated 120,000 refugees from former camps in Bukavu are in this camp.  Fifty-six cases with two deaths have occurred, mostly in age groups over 5 years.  Cholera was confirmed by the Institut Pasteur and the University of Kinshasa from stool specimens collected by Médecins Sans Frontières.  The cases were detected through the epidemiological surveillance system set up by Médecins Sans Frontières(MSF)/Epicentre in the camp.   General health situation :  According to MSF/Epicentre the surveillance system registered increasing daily crude mortality rates which reached 4 per 10 000 in the week beginning 6 January.  Fifty-four percent of the deaths occurred in children under five.  The main causes of death were malnutrition, diarrhoea and malaria.  As of 13 January, 200 children had been admitted to intensive feeding centres and more than 1 800 children were given supplementary food rations.  The nutritional situation is expected to further deteriorate since only 30 tons of the 70 tons needed can be distributed daily.   Acute diarrhoea accounted for 15% of attendance at the health centre and malaria for 40%.  Cerebral malaria was the main cause of death in adults.  As the camp is located in a high endemicity area and the refugee population is likely to have low immunity against Plasmodium falciparum, malaria is expected to increase during the rainy season which is approaching.   The distribution of an adequate food ration to the entire population of the camp is the top health priority.  Surveillance and control of acute diarrhoea and malaria are other priorities to reduce excess mortality in the refugee population.

The second case, a close friend of the hunter became ill and died in August, and the third and four deaths were in a traditional healer and his assistant who treated him. They occurred late in September and blood specimens from them were confirmed Ebola positive on 4 October by the Centre International de Recherche de Franceville (CIRMF), Gabon.  The outbreak was brought under control and by 13 November 1997, it numbered 24 cases (clinical and epidemiological case definition from Kikwit) including 17 deaths and only one known contact still requiring surveillance.  However, on 27 October, a doctor infected in Libreville by a case linked to the Booué outbreak, went  to South Africa for treatment after having developed symptoms.  He subsequently infected a nurse in Johannesburg. The nurse become ill on November 2 and died on 24 November.   On 26 November, a previously unidentified contact in Gabon died in the village of Djidjii, near Booué, and his burial was attended by his brother and his family from Libreville. His brother came back to Libreville with his three children as well as the children of the deceased. All were regularly followed up and 3 developed symptoms of Ebola infection and died in a Libreville hospital. One of them who became ill on 21 December and died on 30 December,  is the last recorded case. As of date 8 January 1997, the outbreak, ongoing since July 1997, has caused 54 cases including 41 deaths, three hospitalised cases and 10 who have recocered. There has been  no documented secondary transmission in Libreville other than that of the doctor who flew to South Africa. A total of 167 contacts are still under daily surveillance. All known contacts have been located and are followed up daily. It is possible that few of them may have been infected and will therefore develop disease.   International travel : WHO does not recommend any travel restriction either to or from Gabon or any other Ebola endemic country. However, it is recommended for all travellers going to an Ebola endemic area, with the specific intention to provide health care or perform laboratory tests from human or animal specimens, that they be aware of the risk of infection from Ebola and other pathogens and adhere strictly to good hygiene and biosafety practices. Travellers arriving from an Ebola endemic area who have been in physical contact with a case should inform the health authority immediately on their arrival to ensure daily temperature check up for a period of three weeks.   There is no epidemiological evidence that persons infected but asymptomatic are infectious to others.  Only symptomatic persons (e.g. contact subject with fever) should be considered as suspect cases and, consequently, potentially infectious. Since severely ill patients  excreting abundant body fluids are not likely to travel,  the risk to travellers of becoming infected by the Ebola virus during travel is considered negligible. However, the risk of health care providers becoming infected through close physical contact with an Ebola patient should be considered, even if statistically low. This is  particularly important for health workers in areas receiving a significant number of passengers from Ebola endemic areas.  For individuals entering the country from an infected area, a simple information leaflet can be used to inform arriving travellers of the need to report any febrile illness occurring up to 21 days after arrival. A questionnaire may be proposed to help tracing if necessary. Such procedures are at the discretion of governments and are not required under the International Health Regulations.  "

This outbreak has been attributed to the consumption of fish contaminated with   pesticides, but little scientific data are available to substantiate these claims.   Concurrently, there are outbreaks of both cholera and dysentery in the country and local   health services have difficulty differentiating between symptoms of chemical poisoning and   illness caused by microbial pathogens. Approximately 100 deaths have occurred and about   600 cases of illness have been reported by the provincial health authorities, but   attributing these to either chemical or microbiological contamination of food or water   consumed is not possible because of lack of reliable scientific data.   According to local health authorities in Cabo Delgado, there have been 2 deaths since 24 November, and the outbreak is under control. Data from the Ministry of   Health suggest that most of the cases of diarrhoea reported in Cabo Delgado province have   been associated with cholera and dysentery, rather than with pesticide poisoning. Thus   caution is advised in the absence of reliable epidemiological data.   It would appear that the  toxic event  associated with pesticide poisoning has passed its peak. The consumption of dried fish may be a possible route of exposure to   toxic levels of pesticides, as the use of non-food-grade pesticides has been frequently   reported in different parts of the world as a method for reducing insect spoilage of dried   fish. The fisheries services in Mozambique are taking the appropriate prevention and   control measures, and are collecting samples to be forwarded to an international reference   laboratory for analysis. WHO has assembled a multidisciplinary advisory team in   consultation with the national government agencies concerned and FAO.  "

V. cholera 01 El Tor Owaga has been isolated in one   case. Of the six reported cases, four were imported from Jutiapa, Guatemala; the other two   originated in border areas of El Salvador (Metepán, Santa Ana and San Alejo, La Unión.)   On 19 November, an outbreak of diarrheal disease erupted in the San Juan de Dios Hospital   in the department of Santa Ana on the Guatemala border. All fifteen cases required   hospitalization. This is a suspected outbreak of cholera which is attributed to ingestion   of food sold by a street vendor from Jutiapa, Guatemala. The Ministry of Health initiated   a public information and health education campaign and launched activities to control the   disease, targeting the areas along the Guatemala border.   Cholera: The Surveillance Department of the Ministry of Health reported that between 4-20 November there were 234 confirmed cases of cholera out of a total of 261   reported. There were 17 deaths.

Leptospirosis: On 23 November, the Surveillance Department reported six cases of leptospirosis, five of which were confirmed. Four of the cases occurred in Guatemala City   and two in Escuintla. No deaths were reported.   Dengue: SIGSA reports 277 cases of dengue for Week 45, a rise of almost 200 cases from the previous week.    Malaria: According to SIGSA, the situation is stable.   Cholera: As of 22 November, the Ministry of Health reported 335 cases of cholera, 301 of which were confirmed. Managua reported 156 cases or 52% , followed by   Carazo (46 cases), Masaya (25) and Matagalpa (18 cases). According to an analysis of   trends by the Epidemiological Surveillance System, one can observe an increase in Week 45,   with 102 cases. Seventy-five were reported the preceding week. The Ministry of Health has   taken measures to treat the cases, distribute chlorine, and conduct community education   and environmental health campaigns.   Leptospirosis: Up to 22 November, the Ministry of Health reported 264 suspected cases of leptospirosis, 98.1% of which were in Chinandega and Estelí (136 and 123 cases   respectively). Of the 182 samples processed in laboratories, 42 resulted positive for   Leptospira (23%). The Ministry of Health is sending medical brigades and epidemiologists   to the affected departments and strengthening control measures and community support.   Dengue: The Ministry of Health reports a rise in notification of cases during the last two weeks.   Malaria: According to information from the Ministry, the situation is stable.   Cholera: As of 21 November, the Ministry of Health reported three confirmed cases of cholera and 11 suspected cases in Regions 1, 3 and 4 of the country.   Leptospirosis: On 20 November, the Ministry of Health reported and outbreak of febrile illness compatible with leptospirosis in three municipalities (San Pedro Zula,   Choloma and La Lima in the department of Cortes (Region 3). Four cases were reported with   three deaths. Two of the cases were serologically confirmed. The Ministry of Health has   sent an epidemiological team to the field, strengthening the diagnostic capacity and   improving epidemiological surveillance efforts.   Dengue: As of 21 November, the Ministry reported 1,080 cases of classic dengue, 444 of which occurred in Region 3. A total of 33 suspected cases of hemorragic dengue have   been analyzed, and 15 of these were confirmed. The remainder are being studied. To date, 4   people have died.   Cholera: Health authorities report, as of 20 November, an outbreak of cholera en Saint Martin Village in the Cayo District, with 11 suspected cases and five confirmed. The   latter have been hospitalized in the Belmopan Hospital. In one case, a 78-year-old person   died 12 hours after being hospitalized. The suspected source of infection was contaminated   drinking water from the Roaring Creek. Fifty-two contacts received treatment.   The following situations can be identified from available information: there is epidemic activity of cholera in the five countries affected by Hurricane Mitch.       Guatemala has the highest risk.  there is epidemic activity of leptospirosis in Nicaragua, Honduras and Guatemala. The       area at greatest risk is Estelí and Chinandega, Nicaragua.  there is epidemic activity of hemorragic dengue in the metropolitan region of Honduras.    PAHO recognizes the extraordinary efforts of the local and national health authorities in the five countries affected by Hurricane Mitch to control the risk of epidemics. These   efforts, particularly the improved epidemiological surveillance, have sharply increased   the capacity to suspect and detect cases as well as to confirm instances and eventually   treat diseases that have the potential to cause epidemics. Consequently, we can expect a   significant increase in the epidemiological reporting of cases in the coming weeks.   However, PAHO recommends the immediate establishment of the following measures:   Cholera:   1) Strengthen health control measures, including basic hygiene measures, provision of safe water, and handling and consumption of food from street vendors, among the at-risk   population, particularly in shelters.   2) Intensify local epidemiological surveillance measures of cholera (active identification of cases) in the affected population.   3) Implement social communication campaigns particularly in shelters and among the displaced population and native communities.   Leptospirosis:   1) Strengthen the local capacity to diagnose and quickly treat cases.   2) Stimulate community participation in expanding the application of preventive measures and the early detection of suspected cases.   3) Step up health surveillance measures, including rodent control.   Hemorragic Dengue:   1) Ensure that health authorities have prompt access to suspected cases.   2) Intensify health measures to control vectors.   3) Strengthen local community participation in the control of breeding sites of mosquitos.

Dr. de Ville, who just returned from Honduras and El Salvador, said,  One of our main concerns is control of communicable diseases. While we don't expect catastrophic   outbreaks, that doesn't mean there will be no cases. Cholera, malaria, dengue and   leptospirosis are all present in Central America. To control them, we must invest   significant amounts in control of vectors, food, and water supplies.    Floods also increase risk of schistosomiasis, dengue, yellow fever, malaria, hantavirus, and other diseases, according to PAHO experts. PAHO's Assistant Director, Dr.   Mirta Roses, cited the latest figures on communicable diseases that have been reported to   PAHO by Ministries of Health, noting that many doctors and epidemiologists are out looking   for cases to ensure that any outbreaks are rapidly controlled and the people treated. As a   result of this increased attention, reporting is also increased, she said.   El Salvador has reported six confirmed cases of cholera including one death, all related to contaminated food sold by street vendors near the border of   Guatemala.   Guatemala has reported 234 confirmed cholera cases with 17 deaths, along with seven cases of leptospirosis, six cases of dengue, and 70 cases of malaria.   Cholera cases have appeared in different areas of the country, and all have been   food-related. Five confirmed cases of leptospirosis have been reported, four in Guatemala   City and two in Esquintla.   Nicaragua has reported 335 cholera cases and confirmed 301 in laboratories. The cases include 156 in Managua, 46 in Carazo, 25 in Masaya, 18 in   Matagalpa, 16 in Chinandega, and 13 in Estelí, with the rest scattered in six other   areas. Nicaragua has also reported 264 possible leptospirosis cases, of which 42 have been   confirmed by laboratory, including 30 in Chinandega, 11 in Estelí, and one in Madriz.   Seven people have died from leptospirosis, often transmitted by contact with water   contaminated by rodent urine or feces.   Honduras has reported 14 cases of cholera, 4 cases of leptospirosis with three deaths, 1,080 cases of dengue, 15 confirmed cases of dengue hemorrhagic fever   with four deaths, and 1,567 cases of malaria, including seven deaths.   Belize has reported a cholera outbreak in Saint Martin Village, with 11 suspected and five confirmed cases, including one death. The source of infection is   thought to be contamined water from Roaring Creek, authorities said.   In all countries, health authorities have taken control measures to improve food safety and to guarantee the quality of water for human consumption, and have sent doctors and   epidemiologists to areas where outbreaks have been reported to take control measures and   educate the communities on preventive measures, Dr Roses said.   Emergency supplies are arriving and being widely distributed, using the PAHO-designed SUMA Humanitarian Supply Management system, Dr. de Ville said,  but we already see in   the field many unusable supplies and expired medicines.    The real problem for Central America will be reconstruction and rehabilitation, Dr. de Ville said.  The big item for the health sector in Honduras, for example, is   reconstruction of the water system, which we estimate will cost some $180 million out of   an estimated $220 million in health reconstruction costs, and is a very important   priority.    Noting that PAHO has mobilized some 60 experts to the countries hardest hit by the hurricane, in addition to the 150 already there, Dr. de Ville said,  We have a lot to   learn from this disaster. Were we sufficiently prepared? Could we have done better? How   can we emphasize disaster mitigation to ensure damages will not be so heavy  next   time?  He said an evaluation meeting will be held on Hurricanes Mitch and Georges   February 9th to 12th.   PAHO, founded in 1902, provides technical collaboration in a broad range of fields including emergency preparedness and disaster relief. It works to improve health and   living conditions in the countries of the Americas, and serves as the Regional Office for   the Americas of the World Health Organization.  "

Nicaragua. The areas most damaged are along the Pacific coast and in the northern part of the country. Until now, 2 362 deaths have been confirmed, 970 persons   have disappeared and over 55 000 have been displaced. Major damage has been sustained   by the infrastructure (roads, water supply and sanitation systems) and by agricultural   production.   Reports of suspected cases of cholera in Matalgalpa and Esteli reflect high levels of water contamination and the difficulties associated with chlorine distribution. In   accessible areas, suspected cases of cholera have been managed in a timely fashion by   health personnel. Although there is a risk of an epidemic outbreak, the situation has so   far been under control. Reports on dengue from Leon, Boaco and Rivas do not differ from   the annual averages, however there is probably underreporting of cases in the affected   areas.   On 13 November 1998, 16 suspected cases of leptospirosis were reported in Chinandega, in the community of El Viejo: 8 were hospitalized, 5 have died and 3 have received   laboratory confirmation. In addition, 1 suspected case has been reported in Matagalpa, 1   in Managua and 1 in Esteli.   Of the 8 areas suffering the greatest problems, communication has been reestablished by road in 5. The 3 others can only be reached by air, thus the quantity of drugs, food and   fuel that can be transported there is limited. Many communities remain isolated in all of   the affected areas.   Honduras. The country has been severely affected and losses in human lives, infrastructure and agriculture continue to rise. Earlier estimates of deaths and of   populations at risk have been exceeded as health teams reach previously isolated areas.   Currently 7 000 deaths have been confirmed, 12 000 people have disappeared and over 500   000 were estimated to be living in 938 shelters as of 13 November (down from 800 000 in   the first 24 hours after the passage of the hurricane).

PAHO experts say that although the risk of dengue, malaria, cholera and other diseases has increased, there are, contrary to rumors, no epidemics resulting from Hurricane Mitch. Measures recommended by PAHO/WHO include: health education, sanitation and water supply, and vector control.    Provided they receive generous material support from the international community, the affected countries have the necessary experience to control the epidemiological situation,  said Dr. Claude de Ville, chief of PAHO's Emergency Preparedness and Disaster Relief Program.   He urged public health related humanitarian and non-government organizations to coordinate and consult with the local PAHO/WHO Offices to ensure a common strategy.   In Honduras, where more than 1.9 million were affected, some 7,000 people have died, 6,000 have disappeared, 11,000 are wounded and more than 30,000 families are homeless, PAHO officials are working to reestablish water supplies and strengthen disease surveillance.   Immediate priorities in Honduras also include acquiring essential drugs and vaccines, disseminating educational health messages, improving sanitary conditions in shelters, and reestablishing the network of health services throughout the country. Honduran officials say urgent needs still include Bailey bridges, food, water and medicines.   PAHO is also working on control of mosquitoes and other disease vectors, promotion of safe food handling in shelters and affected areas, and mental health for people affected by the disaster. The Organization is working with Honduras in damage evaluation and reconstruction project design, and in the Relief Supplies Management Project (SUMA) to help sort, classify, track and report on donations.   The SUMA system helps authorities and aid agencies manage large quantities of supplies, which often pose serious logistic and management problems for national authorities, while remaining transparent and accountable. SUMA began as a PAHO/WHO technical cooperation project in Latin America and the Caribbean in 1990 and has since trained 1400 officers in more than 30 countries in the Americas and in other regions of the world.

At that point, and subsequently for a number of days, it stalled off the coast,   producing very heavy rainfall. The rains in many countries in Central America, caused   rivers to overflow and provoked serious mudslides in many areas.   To date, it has been very difficult to finalize an evaluation of health sector needs because of conditions in the country. There are no communications within the country.   Tegucigalpa is inaccessible from the north, south and west of the country, making it very   difficult for fuel and food to arrive. The roads to the north and to the south are   seriously damaged. At this writing, more than 5,000 people have lost their lives,   approximately 1.5 million persons have been affected, 500,000 have been evacuated, an   estimated 70,000 homes have been damaged. (These figures are conservative.)   The 50-bed San Lorenzo Hospital was destroyed. The Social Security Hospital is not serviceable. The roof of the Roatan Hospital was totally destroyed. Other units of the   health services network suffered considerable damages, and are without electrical energy   and water supply. A large percentage of health workers are themselves among the affected   and/or evacuated.   Some of the most pressing needs are for medicines and other critical supplies; vector control; adequate collection and treatment of solid waste; rehabilitation of primary   health services; health education and communication; equipment for the San Lorenzo   Hospital; and assessment of the damages and project design for the rehabilitation phase.   The water distribution system is damaged, and the network needs urgent repair. The majority of surface water outlets have disappeared. In coming weeks, Tegucigalpa will   suffer water rationing, and even the areas that can be repaired most quickly will only   have water once or twice a week.   Nicaragua's National Civil Defense System has provided the following figures (as of 4 November) on the number of people affected by Hurricane Mitch:   Families  Adults  Children  Injured  Deaths  Missing  136,930  405,526  342,037  229  1,368  1,804    The Pacific and northern regions of the country were most affected. In addition to the actual and potential loss of life, the principal damages can be summarized as follows: In addition to the widespread threat of vector borne diseases, there is a severe threat       of diarrhea, respiratory and dermatological diseases.  Much of the country's infrastructure was partially or totally destroyed, including 2500       km. of roads and more than 80 bridges.  Environmental deterioration, contamination and destruction of basic services such as       water supply systems, wells, latrines, as well as an increase in the number of areas which       have become a breeding ground for vectors.  Generalized overcrowding in shelters designed to accommodate fewer people, with a lack       of proper waste management services.  EL SALVADOR   There has been a great deal of damage to infrastructure in this country. The death toll is 239 and 60,000 people have been displaced and are being housed in 107 shelters   throughout the country.   In spite of efforts by national authorities to adequately house all of the population who need shelter, health and sanitation conditions may deteriorate in the current   conditions persist for a lengthy period of time.

Although epidemics are relatively rare in   the aftermath of natural disasters, in this case there is a combination of high-risk   factors which could lead to an increase in the transmission of communicable diseases: the   magnitude of the hurricane, the large number of displaced persons, the contamination of   drinking-water and poor sanitation conditions.   Even though the mosquito population may decrease (washing effect of the storm) in the first weeks following the hurricane, it will inevitably rebound due to the subsequent   accumulation of stagnant water. This could lead to an increased risk of malaria and dengue   epidemics in an area that is already highly endemic for these diseases.   Cholera is also endemic in Central America, and again the risk of transmission is likely to increase. Information regarding suspected cases of cholera in the suburbs of   Managua (Nicaragua) has recently been received from field workers.   Although no epidemic has been confirmed so far, WHO strongly recommends that relief agencies pay particular attention to epidemic readiness and water safety activities.  "

It is expected to be particularly deadly in Mogadishu this year, owing to the following factors:  The World Food Programme/Food and Agriculture Organization (WFP/FAO) have estimated the structural food deficit to be quite large. It is expected to result in the additional movement of around 200,000 internally displaced people from Bay and other regions to Mogadishu. These people will be malnourished and obliged to live on the outskirts of Mogadishu without access to safe water.  No international NGO is currently present in Mogadishu. Although Somali professionals have been adequately trained in cholera prevention and treatment, NGO financial support to the staff of cholera treatment centres in the past has greatly contributed to their success in combating the disease. This year, it appears very unlikely that any donor will financially support the staff of these centres.  The United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) has notified termination to many staff in Mogadishu. As a result, their support to chlorination activities in the city is expected to be significantly reduced. However, UNICEF will step up the use of mass media for hygiene awareness and safe water campaigns.  The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) has withdrawn from the Mogadishu area. Its past support to cholera treatment activities in southern Mogadishu was instrumental in preventing many deaths, but it will not be available this season.   WHO currently employs a local laboratory technician and two local doctors in Somalia as public health coordinators.   Unless the current security conditions in Mogadishu are improved, the cholera epidemic response this season will be seriously compromised.  "

Although no major outbreaks have been caused by V. cholerae O139 since 1994, the fear that this new strain could become a global threat is still present, particularly in   Asia, where extremely heavy rainfalls and floods have contributed to an increase in cases   and deaths due to cholera.   The WHO Global Cholera Task Force recommends that efforts to monitor the spread of V. cholerae O139 at a global level must be continued and/or strengthened.  "

"1998","http://www.who.int/csr/don/1998_09_02/en/index.html"," 1998 - Cholera in Afghanistan, Update 2   02 September 1998  Disease Outbreak Reported   This is a press release issued by the WHO Office in Afghanistan.   World Health Organisation (WHO) in Afghanistan reports worsening of the national outbreak of acute gastroenteritis and suspected cholera in some regions. Only six   hospitals in Kabul last week reported 1400 cases of acute severe diarrhoea,   gastroenteritis, and suspected cholera. This is the third week of the epidemic and more   emergency medical supplies provided by WHO -Afghanistan have now reached Kabul and   distribution is underway.   In Bamyan from the 19th to the 26th of August 1998, 328 cases of acute severe diarrhoea and suspected cholera were reported including 28 deaths of affected men, women, and   children. The civil war in Afghanistan has brought thousands of internally displaced   people into the Bamyan area from the North. This overcrowding has further aggravated the   dangerous situation of water and sanitation. At the same time, the isolation of the area   means that the health facilities have little surplus to respond to the pressure of an   epidemic. The hospital and clinics in Bamyan have minimal supplies of antibiotics and ORS   to last until the end of the week. Their supply of intravenous fluid is exhausted and they   are borrowing from Afghan Red Crescent Society supplies of fluids provided by ICRC for war   wounded.   In response to the suspected cholera outbreak, WHO-Afghanistan began shipping emergency supplies to every region of Afghanistan in the middle of August. Supplies for Bamyan were   waiting for the next UN flight from Islamabad when the US missile attacks on Afghanistan   occurred and all flights were suspended. This week WHO is arranging for transfer of   emergency medical supplies from Ghazni by road. Using the only available land route, the   supplies can reach Bamyan no sooner than 3-4 days due to the bad road conditions.   The long road to Bamyan also crosses two front lines in the civil war. However, since the World Health Organisation has a long-standing reputation as being neutral and   impartial and having a good relationship with authorities on either side of the border,   permit has been granted and their trucks of supplies expect to get through safely.   In other areas of Afghanistan the outbreak of suspected cholera has continued to claim lives -- Baghlan, Laghman, Takhar, Samangan, Kunduz, Badakhshan, Uruzgan and Ghazni. A new   outbreak of acute gastroenteritis was reported this week from Herat with 86 hospitalized   and one death. Control of the outbreak depends on providing safe drinking water through   chlorination or other means and health education about using ORS to treat diarrhoea to   prevent dehydration. To contain the epidemic and avoid future outbreaks, city-wide and   nation-wide efforts are required to improve water and sanitation.  "

The World Health Organisation in Afghanistan reports a very serious and widespread national outbreak of acute diarrhoea and suspected cholera. A sharply increasing number of   cases of severe acute diarrhoea have been reported from the Northern, North-eastern,   Central, Eastern, Southern and South-eastern Regions of Afghanistan.   In Kabul, a Task Force including the Ministry of Health, WHO, UNICEF and ICRC was established to mobilise available resources, but more funds are required to secure the   safe drinking water supply to bring the outbreak under control there. Funds or   contributions in kind are also desperately needed to airlift medical supplies to the North   and North-eastern Regions as well as to implement water and sanitation measures to control   the outbreak in all regions.   In the Central Region, the WHO sub-office reports that more than 10,000 cases of acute diarrhoea, especially among women and children, have been registered in the 59 health   facilities in Kabul over the last ten days with a few deaths. As the safe water situation   is deteriorating in the city, the death rate is likely to increase.   In the Northern and North-eastern Regions where access is difficult, the case fatality rate is 3-15%. From Baghlan, the Swedish Committee of Afghanistan reports 3500 cases of   severe acute diarrhoea with 102 deaths and from Takhar 300 cases with 8 deaths. The   outbreak may have spread also to Samangan Province. From Kunduz, the WHO sub-office   reports 128 cases of severe acute diarrhoea and 20 deaths, and from Badakhshan Province,   26 cases and 6 deaths.

Many countries/areas in Asia have been experiencing unusually high levels of dengue/dengue   haemorrhagic fever activity in 1998.   Over the past 2 decades, 29 out of the 37 countries/areas in the WHO Western Pacific Region have reported dengue cases. The disease has been reported more or less annually by   15 countries, including Cambodia, China, Lao People's Democratic Republic, Malaysia, the   Philippines, Singapore, Viet Nam and several Pacific island countries/areas. During   1993-1997, a total of 552 088 cases was reported from the Region. Of these, 70% were   reported from Viet Nam alone. The case-fatality rate (CFR) has been declining in most of   the endemic countries in the Region over the last 2 decades due to better understanding of   the pathogenesis and improvement in case management. The overall CFR in the Region is now   less than 1%. However, in some countries the CFR still exceeds 4% due to factors such as   admission to hospital when the disease is in an advanced state.   In newly industrialized countries such as Malaysia and Singapore, dengue incidence once declined owing to successful vector control programmes, but a resurgence in the number of   cases has been reported since 1994. In the Pacific island countries/areas, the   reappearence of dengue type 2 was confirmed in 1996 for the first time since the 1980s.   The occurrence of dengue cases in most countries of the WHO Western Pacific Region reaches its peak during the period June-November each year. The level of activity so far   in 1998 has been considerably higher than in previous years. A major contributing factor   may be changes in weather patterns, such as the El Niño phenomenon.  "

A total of 271 cases have been   hospitalised with serious complications (aseptic meningitis, encephalitis). Ninety percent   of deaths and 86% of hospitalised cases were below six years of age.   The number of hospitalised cases has gradually increased since April 1998, peaked during the period from 24  30 May, and thereafter began to decline. Cases have been   reported from all regions of Taiwan, with the highest number from the Northern Region.   Various estimates put the total number of infants and children affected by hand, foot and   mouth disease between 60,000 and 300,000.   Enteroviruses, in particular EV-71, have been isolated from throat and rectal swabs, stools, cerebrospinal fluid and other specimens from fatal and non-fatal cases. Two cases   with brain stem encephalitis have been autopsied in Taipei, and EV-71 has been detected in   brain stem and spinal cord in one case (8-year-old female), These discoveries have led   Department of Health officials to believe that enterovirus type-71 is implicated.   The Department of Health in Taiwan formed a special task force to monitor the epidemic and to prevent its spread. As there is no vaccine for the virus, the health authorities   recommend that parents keep their children away from public places and make sure that   children wash their hands often to reduce the risk of infection.   A Singaporean boy aged two and a half years died on 25 June following hand, foot and mouth disease complicated by encephalitis. The boy had no history of travel to Taiwan   recently. Laboratory investigation for enteroviruses is being carried out, and the result   will be available in one to four weeks. No enterovirus 71 infection has been detected in   Singapore this year.   Recently reports in the media in Hong Kong have quoted Department of Health sources indicating that during the last two weeks of June four cases associated with hand, foot   and mouth disease were hospitalised, although no deaths were reported.

"1998","http://www.who.int/csr/don/1998_06_08e/en/index.html"," 1998 - Dengue   08 June 1998  Disease Outbreak Reported   Many countries/areas in south-east Asia (Malaysia, Taiwan [China], Cambodia, Viet Nam, Thailand, Philippines, Indonesia, Myanmar), the western   Pacific (Guam, Cook Islands, Fiji, New Caledonia, Kiribati) and Latin America (Brazil,   Venezuela, Columbia) have recently been experiencing unusually high levels of   dengue/dengue haemorrhagic fever activity. Although there is often a seasonal increase in   dengue in some of these countries/areas at this time of the year, the level of activity in   1998 is considerably higher than in previous years. Changes in weather patterns as a   result of the El Nino phenomenon are thought to be a major contributing factor.   Unless more effective measures are taken to control the main vector, Aedes aegypti , in these and other countries/areas, dengue will continue to be a growing problem in   tropical and subtropical regions of the world. Essential elements of an effective   programme are integrated mosquito control with community and intersectoral involvement,   vector surveillance for monitoring and evaluation, emergency preparedness, capacity   building and training, and applied research.   A total of 16,647 cases of dengue/dengue haemorraghic fever with 55 deaths (case fatality rate = 0.3%) has been reported since the beginning of 1998. The incidence of   cases has more than doubled compared with the same period last year. In 1997 the number of   dengue cases reported (108,000 cases and 245 deaths) was the highest since 1991. As the   traditional peak season for dengue (June to November) has only just started a major   epidemic is expected to occur. While dengue 2 virus was the most prevalent strain in 1997,   early data suggests that dengue 3 virus predominates this year, but it should be noted   that very few viruses have been typed. Six provinces in southern Viet Nam have been   provided with materials for surveillance and testing and all provincial district hospitals   in the southern region have been supplied with haematocrit equipment for the management of   cases of dengue haemorrhagic fever.   A total of 5,337 cases (of which 194 were dengue haemorraghic fever) with five deaths has been reported since the beginning of 1998. The number of cases is comparable to the   number reported for the same period last year. The 1997 total of reported cases (19,544   cases and 50 deaths) was the highest since 1990. As the traditional dengue season only   began in May it is too early to assess the trend during 1998.   There has been a rapid increase recently in dengue/dengue haemorrhagic fever cases and all provinces of the country are now affected. As of 5 May a total of 32,665 cases with   774 deaths had been reported. This number of cases is considerably higher than in the same   period last year. It is expected that cases will continue to increase during the peak   transmission season of May to July. WHO is assisting the Ministry of Health in their   efforts to control the situation by providing guidelines on clinical management of cases   and laboratory services during epidemics, sending an expert to assist in developing a   control strategy, and providing support for laboratory studies.   This year Brazil is experiencing the highest levels of dengue transmission in its history. A total of 234,828 cases was reported during the first four months of 1998,   compared with 159,965 cases during the same period in 1997 and 254,942 cases reported for   the entire year in1997. Transmission appears to have peaked in April, as it did last year.   There have been 60 cases of dengue haemorrhagic fever reported and eight deaths. Both   dengue 1 and dengue 2 viruses are circulating. Approximately 60% of all dengue cases in   the Americas are reported from Brazil, but less than 1% of the dengue haemorrhagic fever   cases. The area with the greatest transmission has been the south-east region, with 89,000   cases in the State of Minas Gerais and 35,000 cases in the State of Espirito Santo. All   but four of the 27 states/territories in Brazil are affected.   In 1997 Brazil launched its Aedes aegypti Eradication Program. About US$448 millions were spent to hire, train and equip tens of thousands of inspectors to visit each   house in infested areas every three months to eliminate breeding sites. Unfortunately, the   deployment process has been very slow, because it involves making contracts with each of   the 2,500 infested municipalities. At present, inspectors are working in 1,300   municipalities. Emergency measures have included ultra-low-volume application of   insecticides with vehicle-mounted sprayers, massive dissemination of information to the   public about Aedes breeding sites and how to eliminate them, and plans for aircraft   application of insecticide.

The provinces of     Katanga, Nord-Kivu, Sud-Kivu and Orientale are currently the most affected by cholera     outbreaks. The provinces of Kinsasha and Equateur have reported only a few cases. Although     the outbreak is in regression in the province of Katanga, the situation in Sud- Kivu,     Nord-Kivu and Orientale provinces is still of serious concern. Many activities to prevent     further spread and to treat affected populations are being undertaken by the MOH in     collaboration with WHO, UNICEF, MSF and other NGO's.   From 1 April to 18 May, 77 cases of cholera and 3 deaths have been reported in Bujumbura Province, Burundi . The districts of Buyenzi, Bwiza, Cibitoke and Musaga     are the most affected. Health education and activities to improve sanitation are being     carried out by the MOH.   Cases of cholera started to be reported in Rwanda in March in Cyangugu prefecture which is on the border with the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Although the     number of cases is not very high at present, there is major concern about further spread     to other areas of the country.   In Uganda , the dramatic cholera outbreak which started in late 1997 is still affecting the country with over 20,000 cases and over 1,000 deaths reported since the     beginning of the year.   The current cholera outbreak affecting the Great Lakes region confirms earlier forecasts of a potential spread from eastern African countries which were affected by     major outbreaks last year to countries in the central and southern part of Africa.

Despite control measures which are being undertaken, past experience   suggests that the cholera epidemic will spread to other countries, accompanied by a very   negative impact on public health and serious social and economic consequences.   National authorities in collaboration with WHO and other agencies are continuing to implement and strengthen cholera prevention and control measures in the affected countries   and countries at risk. The cholera situation in the region has triggered questions and   interest regarding appropriate measures to prevent the international spread of cholera.   WHO advises that travel and trade restrictions have never proved to be effective in controlling the international spread of cholera but that sound public health practices are   the most effective approach.   WHO therefore recommends that:   countries should not use travel and trade restrictions, quarantine or frontier controls in the efforts to prevent the spread of cholera; if there is a theoretical risk of cholera   transmission through trade, agreement should be reached between exporting and importing   countries on the most appropriate public health measures to prevent transmission.

"1998","http://www.who.int/csr/don/1998_01_06b/en/index.html"," 1998 - Rift Valley fever in Kenya   06 January 1998  Disease Outbreak Reported   Rift Valley fever has been confirmed in an outbreak which affected humans and domestic animals (goat, sheep, cattle and camels) in Garissa District, a remote area of   northeastern Kenya. The outbreak area is difficult to access and the full extent of the   outbreak is not yet known but reports indicate that up to 300 people may have died from   the disease.   The first evidence that Rift Valley fever was responsible for the outbreak was obtained on 31 December in the WHO Collaborating Centre at the National Institute for Virology,   Johannesburg, South Africa. In testing the first sera available from the outbreak (from 36   human cases and one calf), four sera were PCR-positive and RVF was subsequently confirmed   when the virus was isolated from three of them. Antibody to RVF virus was detected in 17   sera by either indirect immunofluorescence or IgG or IgM ELISA tests. Eight of 12 sera   which could be retested had haemagglutination inhibition antibody to RVF.   Because the population affected is undernourished and subject to various diseases, particularly those associated with a lack of clean drinking water and of health services,   other severe diseases that normally occur in the area, such as shigellosis and malaria,   may partially explain the large number of deaths in the region.   Additional epidemiological studies using a uniform case definition are needed to better understand the scope and nature of the epidemic as well as the support and control   measures required. Laboratory investigations, including on samples taken from animals, are   continuing at NIV and another WHO Collaborating Centre, the Centers for Disease Control   and Prevention (CDC) in Atlanta, USA.   Rift Valley fever virus is a member of the family Bunyaviridae and is in the Phlebovirus genus. The virus was first isolated in 1931 during a disease outbreak in livestock on   a farm located in the Rift Valley of Kenya. The virus is endemic to Africa, south of the   Sahara desert, but infections have periodically extended into Egypt. During epizootics   (epidemics in animals), the virus causes spontaneous abortion in ewes and cows and deaths   in lambs and calves. In humans, the virus produces a usually non-fatal dengue-like   illness. Less frequently, infection results in retinitis, encephalitis and haemorrhagic   disease, the latter condition being consistent with the present outbreak. Rift Valley   fever virus is transmitted by mosquitoes and many different species can serve as vectors.   Humans can also be infected by contact with blood or body fluids from infected animals   which may occur during slaughtering of the animals or handling of aborted foetuses. The   risk of human-to-human infection through direct contact appears to be very low.   WHO does not recommend any restrictions on travel to Kenya as the area affected is remote and far from the tourist centres of Nairobi, Mombassa and the game parks.  "

On 30 July 1999, the Ministry of Health of New Zealand reported an imported case of cholera to WHO and to the Ministry of Health of Fiji. Vibrio cholerae O1 El Tor   subtype Ogawa had been confirmed in a 26-year-old male from New Zealand who had visited a   small offshore reef island in Fiji as a tourist in June 1999. He had experienced onset of   symptoms on the fourth day of his visit. A similar case in a visitor from New Zealand,   possibly acquired at the same Fiji island resort, was investigated by the Ministry of   Health of Fiji 8 months earlier. No other cases were found at that time.   After the second report, the Ministry of Health of Fiji launched a thorough investigation, in collaboration with WHO. No further cholera cases have been detected, but   the investigators did find evidence of faecal contamination of the island's fresh water   source (i.e. the groundwater lens) and of the salt water intake for a desalination   facility purchased by the resort a few years earlier. Water samples from boreholes that   draw from the groundwater lens have revealed the presence of Vibrio parahaemolyticus , V. mimicus O36, and V. cholerae O19. Vibrio cholerae O1 has not been   found in the water samples taken.   The island's drinking-water is separately obtained from a rainwater catchment system, supplemented by barged water from outside the island, and supplied to guest rooms in   plastic jugs. All water sources (borehole, desalinator, rain catchment, and barged water)   are chlorinated before distribution. Although the borehole and desalinated water is not   intended for drinking, investigators considered it likely that the infections had occurred   either by consumption of foods contaminated in the kitchen with inadequately treated   borehole water, or by inadvertent consumption of the water itself when free residual   chlorine was absent.   Revised chlorination procedures are currently in place to provide added protection in the short term for residents and visitors. Other measures have already been taken to   provide a long-term solution on the affected island. There is no evidence to suggest that   a problem exists in Fiji beyond this small resort island, and Fiji's water supply is   generally considered safe.   Note: The public health response in this case       illustrates the usefulness of quick and effective communication between countries. There       is no risk for travellers to this area in view of the long term measures put into place to       solve the problem on this small offshore island.   "

"1999","http://www.who.int/csr/don/1999_09_24/en/index.html"," 1999 - Polio in Iraq   24 September 1999  Disease Outbreak Reported   Since May 10 1999, 16 cases of paralytic poliomyelitis, confirmed by isolation of wild poliovirus type 1 have occurred in nine of 15 central / southern governorates of Iraq.  As of September 20, there were an additional 9 cases with isolation of poliovirus type 1 pending intratypic differentiation, as well as 10 cases with onset of paralysis in August, pending virus isolation results. These findings indicate widespread transmission of wild poliovirus in Iraq, where wild poliovirus type 1 was last isolated from a case each in Ninevah and Wasit governorates with onset in April and May 1997, respectively. The outbreak presents a serious challenge to the polio eradication initiative in Iraq, and threatens re-introduction of virus in neighbouring countries, especially Islamic Republic of Iran, Jordan, Syrian Arab Republic and Turkey.   Nine of 16 wild-virus confirmed cases (onset May to July) belong to nomadic cattle-herding families, while most cases reported since August are among children of resident families. Fourteen of 16 (88%) wild-virus confirmed cases are 2 years of age or younger, and 11 of 16 cases (69%) had either no previous oral polio vaccine dose (9/16) or were incompletely immunized (2/16). Factors contributing to this outbreak are declining routine immunization coverage in many areas, as well as insufficient National Immunization Day (NID) coverage in south and central governorates, especially among high-risk populations.   To respond to this outbreak and to interrupt wild poliovirus transmission, Iraq has decided to conduct two rounds of NIDs targeting children aged < 5 yrs in early October and early November 1999. Two rounds of NIDs will follow these in the spring of 2000. To assure that all children in high-risk populations are covered, existing NID plans at governorate and district level (microplanning) will be revised, where necessary. Also, acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) surveillance at major hospitals and other facilities likely to see children with acute paralysis has been enhanced.

As at 31 August 1999, a total of 6 964 cases have been reported to WHO this year.   The disease is appearing in new areas and since 1 August, 3-4 cases of watery diarrhoea have been registered every day at Bosaso hospital; in all 190 cases have been admitted, of which 84 were males and 106 females (F:M ratio, 1.26:1). The age group most affected has been > 5years (60% of cases). There have been 15 deaths (case-fatality rate, 8%).   On 5 August, 5 rectal swabs were sent to the AMREF laboratory services in Nairobi (Kenya) for identification, culture and sensitivity tests. Vibrio cholerae serotype Ogawa has been isolated from 1 of these. The result of the antibiogram indicates sensitivity to tetracycline and nalidixic acid, but resistance to chloramphenicol, erythromycin, cotrimoxazole and ampicillin.   Over 90 % of cases are from the same residential area. Investigations have shown that they had been drinking from 100 wells located in that same area, and which are adjacent to pit latrines.   Three control committees have been set up in Bosaso town, namely for social mobilization, water and sanitation, and case management. The wells which have been shown by analysis to be positive for vibrios are being chlorinated by the water and sanitation committee with the help of WHO and UNICEF.  UNICEF is working on a piped-water project for the area.   A focal point for control of the epidemic has been appointed to work closely with local WHO staff, who have also conducted a series of training sessions for the hospital staff on case management of cholera, in close collaboration with UNICEF and local authorities. Intensive health education and social mobilization are ongoing, targeting especially the affected residential area. Supplies of ringer's lactate solutions, chlorine and antibiotics are sufficient.  "

This press release issued by WHO Afghanistan on 2 September 1999 provides more detailed information about these measures:   SAFE WATER PROJECT IN KABUL TO CONTROL DIARRHOEAL DISEASES/CHOLERA OUTBREAK   A comprehensive life-saving water project is now underway in Kabul and has so far chlorinated 45,000 shallow wells and set as its goal 130,000 wells in two months.   In order to control water-borne disease and the cholera outbreak in the Afghan capital, WHO in collaboration with the Ministry of Public Health, WFP, UNICEF are co-operating in implementing the shallow wells chlorination programme, while other UN agencies and NGOs like UNCHS, ICRC, DACCAR, SCA, ACF, and MRRD are co-ordinating the joint chlorination and hygiene education campaign.   The shallow wells' chlorination campaign was officially inaugurated by Deputy-Public Health Minister at the Ministry conference hall on 16 August 1999. He encouraged the people to support the chlorination campaign saying,  lack of hygienic drinking water is the main cause of the emergence of diarrhoea and cholera . According to the action plan of the campaign, Kabul City is divided into 28 clusters, each with one supervisor of 3-6 teams. Each team is to chlorinate 20-30 wells per day, handling up to 600-900 households during the campaign. The whole process will be thoroughly supervised by a joint team representing MOPH and the aforementioned UN agencies and NGOs.   The campaign will continue until October 1999 and will include house-to-house field visits by 30 female hygiene educators. The female health educators have been selected from the targeted communities, or have been identified by MOPH to convey health messages to each family about family and environmental sanitation and to raise public awareness about the entire sanitation process. School teachers, mullahs, Imams, and mass and print media are also fully involved and playing a constructive role in the implementation of this life-saving project.   The World Food Programme has kindly provided 205 MT of wheat as food for work to this life-saving project and each of the other agencies are providing appropriate support in cash and kind. The total estimated campaign cost is US $172,000.  "

Since early May, a total of 26 cases of children with paralysis have been reported as of today, of which 6 cases have already been confirmed as poliomyelitis through laboratory analysis. Fifteen of the 26 cases were reported from Kunduz town itself, with 11 cases from the districts surrounding Kunduz.   The outbreak was identified only because special disease reporting for suspected polio cases, including the capacity for laboratory confirmation, was established in May 1999 in the North as part of the nation-wide initiative to eradicate polio.   Since all immunization activities in Northern Afghanistan had nearly ceased in mid-1997 and are just now being re-established, the outbreak of poliomyelitis is not unexpected.  To determine the full extent of the outbreak, all health facilities and NGOs providing health care in the North have been alerted to the outbreak and requested to report all suspected cases to the Ministry of Public Health (MoPH).  A large-scale house-to-house immunization campaign, targeting more than 130,000 children aged < 5 years has been launched this week in the outbreak area as a collaborative effort between MoPH, WHO, UNICEF and NGOs.   Poliomyelitis is endemic in Afghanistan and the best way to prevent the disease is to immunize children with at least 3 doses of polio vaccine during their first year of life. The global strategy to eradicate polio includes supplementary country-wide campaigns called National Immunization Days (NIDs) when 2 drops of oral polio vaccine are given to all children under age 5 years, in 2 consecutive months. Country-wide NIDs were held in Afghanistan in May and June 1999 and are scheduled again for October and November. Unfortunately the outbreak in Kunduz started before the May NIDs.

They have been characterized by transmission upsurges in the highlands in the western part of the country, and more recently in the semiarid north-eastern area, after the 1997 El Nino rains. These outbreaks were generally contained by case management, but the strategy began to fail with increasing chloroquine resistance. This year the epidemic districts were supplied with sulfa-pyrimethamine (SP) at the latest by end-April after the onset of the long rainy season. As a result, the outbreak was kept in check during the early stages, but as the intensity of transmission increased at the beginning of May, the number of patients outstripped the capacity of the health facilities, leading to a severe management crisis at all levels including in drug procurement systems.   Although a general upsurge of malaria cases has been reported in most of the districts which usually experience epidemics, the following 9 districts have been more severely affected: Buret, Gucha, Kisii, Mount Elgon, Narok, Nyamira, Trans Mara, Trans Nzoia and West Pokot.   The epidemic was first reported in Kisii, Mount Elgon, Trans Mara, Trans Nzoia and West Pokot districts, but has since spread to other districts (Gucha, Nandi, Nyamira and Uasin Gishu). Although other areas which regularly report epidemics such as Bomet, Kakamega, Samburu and Turkana have not yet been affected, they are being monitored closely since it is still the traditionally epidemic season for most of them.   The Ministry of Health had established large stocks of antimalarial drugs in the 15 epidemic districts (including North-Eastern province) by the end of April, but these stocks have now been exhausted in most districts owing to the unusually severe outbreak this year. The central supplies unit in Nairobi has also issued all its quinine stocks, and other antimalarial drugs such as SP are fast running out.   In line with the new national guidelines on epidemic preparedness and control. communities are being mobilized to: seek treatment early; attend to personal protection measures including the use of insecticide-treated nets; and participate in antivector activities such as indoor residual spraying, larviciding and environmental management.   It has now become clear that case management alone cannot attenuate these epidemics, and an integrated approach to malaria control is needed. Mortality rates are still at emergency level, and they are not expected to decrease, as the number of new cases continues to rise. Environmental conditions are still suitable for mosquito breeding.   WHO staff in the country and from the Regional Office for Africa and headquarters are fully mobilized. Malaria control activities are being coordinated in collaboration with NGOs such as MSF-France, MERLIN and World Vision. Contacts are being made with other NGOs, and bilateral and multilateral agencies for their possible support.      "

The outbreak started on 16 April and a total of 874 cases with 56 deaths was reported up to 16 May.   Lack of good hygiene and sanitation facilities, as well as difficulty in sending supplies because of poor road conditions in the area, are contributing to the spread of the epidemic. The Ministry of Health is providing oral rehydration salts and antibiotics and is also organizing health education campaigns for the affected and surrounding villages.   Cholera is endemic in Cambodia and 1197 cases and 66 deaths were notified to WHO in 1998.      "

The exact number of deaths due to VHF has not been established, owing to the lack of precise information about the clinical picture of those who have died during the past several months.   Samples from only 9 cases have been available for testing. Three of the 9 patients tested have confirmed Marburg virus infection by antigen testing, virus isolation and PCR. Specimens from all 3 patients with Marburg infection were positive in all 3 assays. Samples from the other 6 patients (66%) were negative by virus detection methods and antibody testing, suggesting another etiology. All three confirmed cases of Marburg fever have died, the latest being a miner who died on 13 May.   Blood samples from those living in the affected area and from health care workers (total of approximately 1000 persons) have been collected. These seroprevalence studies are expected to yield valuable information about the epidemiology of Marburg virus infections in this outbreak of haemorrhagic fever. Ecological studies to determine the reservoir of the Marburg virus have begun.   Many participants in the coordination committee* are expected to leave Durba within the next several days. An active surveillance system has been established and sufficient personnel staff will be on-site to monitor events.   * The coordination committee is composed of experts from: the Ministry of Health and local health authorities; WHO headquarters and the African Region; UNDP; Médecins sans frontières (Belgium and Holland); Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (United States); Institut Pasteur (France, French Guiana and Madagascar); Institute of Tropical Medicine (Belgium).

All of the cases have occurred in the Department of Santa Cruz. A majority of the cases have been in males (75.5%) and in persons >15 years of age (76.9%). No cases in children <1 year have been reported. Mass yellow fever vaccination campaigns have occurred in the two municipalities that have been most affected- Cabezas and Postrervalle- achieving coverage rates of 93% and 97% respectively. The last case identified occurred on 15 April 1999. The goal of the Ministry of Health is to vaccinate 100% of the population in the endemic yellow fever zones this year.   Brazil: For 1999, the total number of confirmed sylvatic yellow fever cases has reached 18, with 3 deaths (case fatality rate of 16.7%). Fifty percent of the cases have been in persons >15 years old, 44.4% have been in children ages 1-15 years and 5.6% (representing one case) have been in children <1 year of age. Most of the cases have occurred in males (72.2%). The outbreak seems to be concentrated in two municipalities Afuá and Breves, in the State of Para. Reports from Brazil show that many of the cases from Afuá were identified through active surveillance and serological surveys after a death due to yellow fever occurred in February 1999.   Although a vaccination campaign was carried out in Afuá achieving 100% coverage, cases continue to occur due to the migration of unimmunized people into the area. Families are migrating to this area for work, primarily harvesting heart of palm. In the process of harvesting the trees, the habitat of the mosquitoes is disrupted and contact with humans, including unimmunized young children, occurs.   Colombia: To date in 1999, the total number of confirmed sylvatic cases is two and both cases were fatal. These two cases were in males, ages 17 and 21 years. The cases occurred in the Departments of Caqueta and Meta. No cases have been reported since January.   Peru: The first confirmed case of sylvatic yellow fever for 1999 was reported in a 25 year old male from the department of Loreto, Amazon region who died on 7 April. In response to this case, mass yellow fever vaccination was initiated in the area. Other cases have occurred in San Martin Department, in the districts of Moyobamba, Jepelacio and Alonso de Alvarado (26 cases), Ayacucho Department in the province of La Mar, district of Anco y Santa Rosa (12 cases), Huanuco Department (5 cases) and Junin Department (5 cases).

Samples from four other suspected cases were negative. Investigations will be initiated to establish whether Marburg fever was responsible for an estimated 76 cases of hemorrhagic fever (52 deaths) that have been reported in Watsa and a nearby community of Durba. Most of the cases were gold miners working in mines near Durba. Epidemiological experts from WHO Headquarters, the WHO  Regional Office for Africa and WHO country offices in Kinshasa, DRC and Kampala, Uganda are joining the Médecins sans frontières (MSF Belgium and MSF Netherlands) team already in the area. Experts from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and from the Institut Pasteur are also expected to arrive in the DRC within several days to join the investigation to determine the current size of the outbreak and further investigate the aetiology of the epidemic. The team will also provide technical assistance to further implement control measures. MSF is establishing a ward to isolate patients and training local healthcare staff to use barrier nursing procedures and protective equipment.   Marburg virus infections, a lethal relative of Ebola (both viruses are in the Filovirus  family), are found in sub-Saharan Africa and occur infrequently. Since the virus was first recognized in 1967 when laboratory workers in Marburg, Germany and Belgrade, Yugoslavia were infected by handling monkeys and monkey tissues from animals imported from Uganda, there have only been  three reports of sporadic cases (1975 in Zimbabwe and South Africa, and in 1980 and 1987 in Kenya). The virus is transmitted to people following contact with infected animals and animal tissues, and from person-to-person by close contact with infected patients and body fluids. The natural reservoirs of Marburg virus and of Ebola virus are unknown.   Both the Marburg and Ebola viruses are often characterized by the sudden onset of fever, malaise, muscle pain, headache and conjunctivitis. This is followed by sore throat, vomiting, diarrhoea, rash, and both internal and external bleeding. Liver function may be abnormal and platelet function may be impaired. No specific treatment or vaccine exists for Marburg disease. Severe cases require intensive supportive care, as patients are frequently dehydrated and in need of intravenous fluids. Experimental studies involving the use of hyperimmune sera on animals demonstrated no long-term protection against the disease after interruption of therapy.   Suspected cases should be isolated from other patients and strict barrier nursing techniques practised. All hospital personnel should be briefed on the nature of the disease and its routes of transmission. Particular emphasis should be placed on ensuring that high-risk procedures such as the placing of intravenous lines and the handling of blood, secretions, catheters and suction devices are done under barrier nursing conditions. Hospital staff should have individual gowns, gloves and masks. Gloves and masks must not be reused unless disinfected. Patients who die from the disease should be promptly buried or cremated.

To date, there have been 157 cases and 58 deaths. New information   indicates that both Japanese encephalitis (JE) and a second virus are circulating. The   second virus, a new member of the paramyxovirus family could be similar to the Hendra   virus found earlier in Australia. Japanese encephalitis has been confirmed to be the cause   of 18 of the reported deaths. Further investigations are now underway to determine the   role of the new viruses in the reported cases.   Japanese encephalitis (JE) is the leading cause of viral encephalitis in Asia with 30 000 to 50 000 cases reported annually. Acute encephalitis can lead to paralysis, coma and   death. In Malaysia, between 9 and 91 cases of JE are reported each year. Major outbreaks   occurred in Langkawi in 1974, Penang in 1988 and in the Serian district of Sarawak in   1992.   Japanese encephalitis virus usually affects pigs and is transmitted by the bite of culex mosquitos. Normally the disease is transmitted among pigs and it is only in   exceptional circumstances that humans are involved.   The initial stages of the current outbreak evidence pointed to JE because of the association of all the cases with pigs and piggeries. However, JE usually affects children   but most of the cases in this outbreak have been young adult males. All have been workers   at or closely associated with piggeries. This suggests the presence of another virus.   The current outbreak of viral encephalitis involves the Kinta district of Perak and the Sikamat and Bukit Pelandok districts of Negri Sembilan state. The highest number of cases   and deaths have been reported from Bukit Pelandok.   The Malaysian Ministry of Health has mounted a well-funded campaign to control the disease. To date, 64 767 people have been vaccinated, 150 000 farms and houses have been   sprayed with insecticide, and an active programme of health education and social   mobilization has been mounted in affected areas. In addition, the Government intends to   destroy more than 300 000 pigs as a means of eliminating the source of the virus.   WHO has been monitoring the situation and has been in regular contact with the Malaysian Ministry of Health since early in the outbreak through its office in Kuala   Lumpur. The Regional Office in Manila has provided technical advice, including information   on JE vaccines.   The WHO Collaborating Centre for Arbovirus Reference and Research at the Department of Medical Microbiology of the University of Malaya in Kuala Lumpur has been at the forefront   of the virological investigation of the current outbreak. Another WHO Collaborating Centre   at the Institute for Tropical Medicine, Nagasaki University, Nagasaki, Japan has also been   carrying out serological confirmation on samples from Malaysia.   Two international teams, one from the United States of America and the other from Australia are now in Kuala Lumpur to help investigate the outbreak. Their role will be to   carry out detailed serological and virological investigations that will provide a clearer   picture of the dynamics of the current outbreak.       WHO fully supports the control efforts being taken by the Malaysian Ministry of Health and is ready to provide technical advice and mobilize additional international resources   to help control the current outbreak.

The village has a population   of 5 400. The deaths occurred among both males and females and involved primarily   infants and the elderly. The most recent case was reported on 26 February. Cases were   treated by the team with chloramphenicol, which resulted in a significant improvement,   suggesting that severely ill patients were suffering from secondary bacterial infections.   There were no deaths among those treated.   The disease is flu-like and is characterized by abrupt onset of fever, headaches and myalgia, followed by chest pain and cough. Living and sanitary conditions are crowded, and   the water supply is unprotected. Nutrition is of poor quality. There are no health   services in this very remote area, which has not been accessed by routine immunization   teams.   Preliminary conclusions of the WHO team in the field is that the outbreak now declining was an influenza-like illness which has affected a large proportion of the population. The   rate of secondary complications (mainly pneumonia) was high. Mortality is 1%-2% of the   total population primarily due to lack of antibiotic availability and overall poor living   and nutritional conditions.

All cases occurred   in rural settings of the department of Santa Cruz, located within 120 - 200 km south of   the city of Santa Cruz de la Sierra. Twenty-two cases (82%) were male and 5 (18%) female.   The age distribution of the cases was 82% of over 15 years of age, 11% of 10 to 15 years,   and 7% of 5 to 10 years. Fifteen cases were not vaccinated with yellow fever, two have   presumptively received the vaccine, and the status of 10 was unknown. Mass immunization   was started immediately after the confirmation of the first reported cases. No suspected   cases have been reported in the last two weeks despite increased surveillance.   In the last 10 years, Bolivia has reported 461 cases of yellow fever. Sixty three cases were reported in 1997 and fifty seven in 1998. During 1997, the   primarily affected Departments were Cochabamba (74%) and Beni (15%). In 1998, the areas   involved were lowlands of the Department of La Paz (44%) and west counties of the   Department of Santa Cruz (30%). In 1999 all cases have been reported from the southeast   counties of Santa Cruz. The trend suggests a southeastward spread of the disease through   the country. The current lower reporting of cases outside of the department of Santa Cruz   may be attributed to vaccinations implemented during the 1997 and 1998 outbreaks. The   presence of the Aedes aegypti mosquito in Santa Cruz has continuously presented a serious   risk to the urbanization of yellow fever.   Bolivia has recently developed with the assistance of PAHO a 5 year project to strengthen its immunization program. This initiative will be in part financed   by the World Bank and includes plans to increase the vaccination coverage of all age   groups in the enzootic areas and to introduce the yellow fever vaccine in the routine   national immunization program.   * Source: Ministry of Health, Bolivia, February 1999  "

Three associated human cases have also been reported, all with a benign   febrile illness.   Towards the end of January, six pregnant buffalo were observed to abort, and, shortly after, 3 giraffes and 1 waterbuck were found dead without obvious signs of predator   attack. Three veterinarians in contact with tissues from these animals developed an   uncomplicated, febrile illness. Deaths among goat kids in adjacent areas have also been   recorded. Virus has been detected in tissues from the buffalo fetuses, the waterbuck, a   giraffe, and 1 veterinarian.   A program of control measures has been instituted: local farmers have been advised to vaccinate their livestock, and public health information on appropriate precautions has   been disseminated to those involved in the livestock industry. Mosquito control measures   have been increased in tourist destinations. However, most human cases of RVF reported in   the past from South Africa were acquired through contact with diseased animals and their   tissues, rather than through mosquito bites, so the general public is not perceived to be   at particular risk of contracting the illness.   Large outbreaks of RVF occurred in South Africa's inland plateau in 1974-76, and a small outbreak was recorded in 1981 in a coastal area of KwaZulu-Natal, but no disease   activity has been detected in the intervening period. Several consecutive years with high   rainfall have favoured the explosion of the Aedes mosquito population which is the   vector for the virus.  "

As reported to WHO on 16 October 2000 by the WHO Collaborating Centre, the National Institute for Virology (NIV) in South Africa, test results had confirmed that Ebola virus was cause of the disease.  NIV has now characterized the virus strain as similar to, but not identical to Ebola-Sudan. Ebola-Sudan was associated with a case-fatality rate of between 50-70% in disease outbreaks in southern Sudan in 1976 and 1979.  The strain appears to be somewhat less virulent than the Ebola-Zaire strain, which has caused epidemics in the former Zaire, now Democratic Republic of Congo, and Gabon with a case-fatality rate of between 70-90%.   Both Ebola strains and the closely-related Marburg virus are found in the central region of Africa. While this is the first recognized outbreak of Ebola haemorrhagic fever in Uganda, it is possible that the strain from the present outbreak has been in Uganda for some time.   Infection control and case management in Gulu district are continuing.  A Community Alert System has been established for actively seeking cases and tracing contacts.  Health education messages are also being widely disseminated and public health awareness about EHF has greatly increased in the community.

This viral haemorrhagic fever causes severe disease amongst both humans and animals, posing a serious public health risk and economic losses due to loss of livestock.   In September 2000, RVF was reported for the first time outside Africa. Cases were confirmed in Saudi Arabia and Yemen. As of 9 October 2000, 321 cases with 32 deaths, and a case fatality rate of 10%, have been reported by the Ministry of Public Health, Yemen.   The response requires strengthening the basic infrastructure, epidemiological surveillance and human resources in Yemen that are needed for dealing with this emergency. In particular, the economic impact of the restriction on animal movement and trade is causing severe hardship amongst local inhabitants.   High-level agreement between Saudi Arabia and Yemen to conduct a joint investigation has ensured effective coordination of the international response to control the disease on both sides of the border. WHO experts are working with both governments in the outbreak zone.   Funds mobilized through the WHO Appeal will help to control and contain the outbreak of RVF within the immediately affected districts in Yemen, and build local capacity to predict and prevent further occurrence.   The Appeal seeks support for vector surveillance and control, strengthening laboratory capacity, capacity building and human resource development, strengthening epidemiological surveillance of RVF and providing essential supplies, equipment and critical supportive materials.   An urgent response to the Appeal is needed to assist the Government of Yemen and strengthen local capacity to take effective action on the first reported cases of RVF outside traditionally-affected areas in Africa.   RVF is a zoonotic disease. It primarily affects animals (cattle, sheep, camels, goats) but can cause outbreaks of disease in humans. Usually, the virus is spread by the bite of infected mosquitoes. During RVF outbreaks, people become infected with RVF either by being bitten by mosquitoes or through contact with the blood, other body fluids or organs of infected animals.

In Yemen, 8 teams of physicians and veterinarians are conducting active surveillance in the outbreak area. The epicentre of the outbreak is in Wadi Mawr, El-Zuhrah district in Hodeidah Governorate. The mean age of affected patients is 36.5 years (range 2 months to 90 years).   Confirmed cases of disease have been detected in villages throughout Wadi Mawr. Laboratory capability has been established to detect IgM and IgG class antibody to RVF. Of 59 persons who met the suspect case definition, 29 (51%) had IgM anti-RVF antibody.  Results of surveys in animals from the outbreak area and adjacent Wadis will be available in the next few days.  Surveillance for disease in animals has detected considerable morbidity and mortality in sheep, goats and cattle (most of which has been reported in Wadi Mawr).   Surveillance in humans and animals is ongoing in these sites to determine the extent of possible transmission.  Surveillance data in humans and animals is being used to define high-risk areas which are being targeted for vector control. Efforts are being made to build local capacity to respond to the outbreak, including training on laboratory methods, vector control and surveillance.   This outbreak has occurred at the same time as the outbreak of RVF in Saudi Arabia ( see previous report ). WHO advises that persons can travel freely to and from both Yemen and Saudi Arabia. Persons travelling within the affected districts should wear long-sleeved shirts and trousers and should use mosquito repellent and bednets, and avoid contact with sick livestock.  "

The first cases of suspected viral haemorrhagic fever were reported in the area on 10 and 11 September. Laboratory analysis at the United States' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in Atlanta, confirmed a diagnosis of RVF in samples from Saudi Arabia.

WHO, in conjunction with its international partners in the field, is:   These are the first cases of Rift Valley Fever reported outside traditionally affected areas in Africa. It is important to establish whether this is a new introduction of the virus or whether, in fact, the pathogen has been present for some time and only now has come to the attention of public health authorities. Ecological studies are being carried out to determine the factors that may have triggered the outbreak.   High-level agreement between Saudi Arabia and Yemen to conduct a joint investigation has ensured effective coordination of the international response to control the disease on both sides of the border. Saudi Arabia and Yemen are sharing useful information, including the investigation protocols, and there is good logistic coordination across the border.   WHO Rift Valley Fever expert Dr Ray Arthur has played a key role investigating and responding to previous RVF outbreaks.  I'm working with both governments in the outbreak zone to facilitate coordination of the investigation and implement control procedures across the border,  he stated.   In Yemen, WHO and partners are assisting with the control of an acute haemorrhagic fever syndrome (suspected to be Rift Valley Fever). Laboratory studies are under way to confirm that the observed disease is in fact RVF. Earlier this week an Epidemic Committee comprised of all relevant Government Ministries in Yemen and a team of international experts, epidemiologists and laboratory technicians from WHO, the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) and the United States' NAMRU-3, a WHO Collaborating Centre in Cairo, began implementation of a joint plan of action to curb the spread of the outbreak.   Dr Arthur plans to arrive in Saudi Arabia today and was replaced yesterday in Yemen by WHO epidemiologist Dr Douglas Klaucke, who will continue the advice and coordination function of WHO.   In Saudi Arabia, WHO, CDC and specialists in entomology and ecological studies from the National Institute of Virology (NIV) in South Africaall partners in the Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network are providing direct assistance to the Ministry of Health and the Field Epidemiology Training Programme (FETP).   Rift Valley Fever is a viral zoonosis that may cause severe disease in both animals and humans leading to high morbidity and mortality.

Laboratory confirmation of the illness in the children is being sought. The report has evoked much public concern. In some of the reports, there were misconceptions about the components of the vaccine used to prevent smallpox, and about why any country might still be retaining stocks of smallpox vaccine. This note aims to clarify these issues.   1) Smallpox vaccine is not made from smallpox virus.   The vaccine which was used for centuries to vaccinate against smallpox was not made from smallpox, but from vaccinia virus. Vaccinia is a different virus from the virus which causes smallpox. However, it is a member of the same family of viruses to which the smallpox virus belongs. The smallpox virus is also known as variola virus. Mass vaccinations with smallpox vaccine made from vaccinia virus led to the eradication of smallpox announced by WHO in 1980. People vaccinated with smallpox vaccine (vaccinia) develop reactions to it which range from mild and transient to severe, and very rarely, fatal.   2) Two countries still keep smallpox virus (variola) stocks.   Although smallpox disease has been eradicated, two laboratories still hold stocks of smallpox virus (variola). These are the WHO Collaborating Centres in Atlanta, USA and Koltsovo, Russian Federation.   3) Many countries still hold smallpox vaccine (vaccinia) stocks.   WHO recommends that countries which still have stocks of smallpox vaccine (vaccinia) maintain these stocks. This recommendation has been made for two reasons. Firstly, small amounts of vaccine are still needed to vaccinate laboratory personnel handling vaccinia virus and other members of this virus family. Some of these viruses are found in nature and cause illness among animals, and some are used in research to make new, safer vaccines against a variety of infectious diseases. Secondly, smallpox vaccine (vaccinia) will also be needed in case of a deliberate or accidental release of smallpox virus (variola), which is a very unlikely event but currently of great concern to some countries.   For further information on this topic, see the summary of the recent meeting of the WHO Advisory Committee on Variola Virus Research, published in the Weekly Epidemiological Record.   4) Disposal of biological materials and pharmaceuticals   All biological materials and pharmaceuticals such as vaccines, drugs and diagnostic specimens should be disposed of safely. Some may require inactivation before disposal. This can be accomplished by autoclaving or incineration.  "

The first cases date back to August 1999. Confirmation of the outbreak came from laboratory tests in Rome, Tirana and Skopje.   Tularemia, which is endemic in many parts of the world, including north America, eastern Europe, China, Japan and Scandinavia, is a bacterial disease normally transmitted from animal hosts and has a variety of clinical manifestations. The symptoms in Kosovo include high fever and body aches, swollen glands and difficulty with swallowing, which continue over a period of a couple of weeks. People with these symptoms should go to their doctor.   There have been no reports of death and in normal daily conditions the disease is not transmitted directly person-to-person. Investigations are continuing to identify the mode of transmission and source in the current outbreak. Tularemia (Francisella tularensis) is also known as Rabbit fever, Deer-fly fever, Ohara disease or Francis disease. Tularemia can be transmitted to humans via ticks, drinking water contaminated by rats, handling of under-cooked infected meat from host animals, such as rabbits, and through contaminated soil. So far 26 municipalities in Kosovo have reported suspected cases. Symptoms are not specific and diagnosis needs to be confirmed by blood tests. Tularemia is easily treatable.   The Institute of Public Health has prepared guidelines for the public and these are now being distributed to medical centres throughout Kosovo. People are being advised to keep their surroundings clean, disinfect or boil drinking water, and ensure that food is kept away from rats and cooked thoroughly. In addition, they are being advised not handle dead rats and rabbits.   International experts on tularemia from WHO, Centers for Disease Prevention and Control (CDC, Fort Collins), Istituto Superiore di Sanità, (ISS, Italy), European Programme for Intervention Epidemiology Training (EPINET) and a senior German epidemiologist and  microbiologist have arrived in Kosovo to help health authorities with the scientific investigation and with outbreak containment.

A team from the Ministry of Health was sent to the affected area and was joined by an epidemiologist and water sanitation officer from the WHO office.   The WHO team visited the 2 health centres where most cases had been reported and checked the records from January 1997 to 15 January 2000 which showed that the number of cases had risen beyond the expected seasonal figures from November 1999 to January 2000. As of 15 January 2000 a total of 1 862 cases with 28 deaths had been reported and adults were more affected than children.   Problems identified were lack of protection of latrines and inadequate water supplies. All unprotected water springs/wells which were inspected were contaminated while most of the protected springs had good quality water.   Control measures were initiated which included intensive health education and case management. Laboratory confirmation of the causative pathogen and analysis of sensitivity to drugs is still awaited. Currently the number of cases appears to be decreasing and the Ministry of Health has sufficient medical supplies to deal with this outbreak.  "

"2000","http://www.who.int/csr/don/2000_01_18/en/index.html"," 2000 - Polio in China   18 January 2000  Disease Outbreak Reported   The following case report is from the WHO Polio Eradication Programme:   The case was first reported to the County EPS in Geizi Township, Xunhua County, Haidong Prefecture, Qinghai Province, on 13 October 1999, and reported to the Provincial EPS on the following day. The case was born on 13 June 1998, had onset of paralysis on 12 October, after a day of fever on 11 October. The parents took the boy to a local private clinic in a neighbouring township when a sudden onset of flaccid paralysis made him unable to stand or walk (both of which he had been capable of before). Two stool samples were taken, the first on 14 October and the second on 25 October. They were analyzed in the provincial laboratory. Both samples yielded poliovirus isolates, which were later typed and differentiated as P1 wild viruses at the national laboratory in Beijing. At the time that the second sample was taken five contacts were sampled, one of which, a four year old cousin of the infected child, was also positive for wild poliovirus. The case child was unregistered and had received zero doses of polio vaccine.   The case belongs to the Sala minority group, a Muslim group of Turkic speaking people whose ancestors migrated to Qinghai from the area of Turkmenistan about seven hundred years ago. There are around 80 000 Sala in China, 60 000 in Qinghai Province (nearly all of which live in Xunhua Sala Autonomous County) and nearly all of the remainder in neighbouring Gansu Province. Adult male Sala travel widely as traders and workers, within Qinghai province and outside to other provinces, including Gansu, Sichuan,Xinjiang, and particularly Tibet, even as far as the border area with Nepal.   Neither the case nor the direct family reported a history of travel outside the county in the two months prior to onset. No visit to the family by a traveler from outside the county was reported to occur during the same period. However, the family, including the case, attended a major festival of Sala people in the county capital during the period 25 to 28 September 1999. Up to 30 000 Sala are reported to have attended this gathering.   Despite intensive investigation in the area of the case, including searches of health facilities, no evidence of wide-scale circulation of wild poliovirus has yet been found. Surveillance quality including laboratory proficiency in Qinghai Province and in neighbouring provinces is in general good. Indications are therefore that the virus has been recently imported.   The Ministry of Health of China is actively collaborating with the global laboratory network including CDC Atlanta, NIID Tokyo and the national laboratories in India. Initial sequencing information on the wild poliovirus show a close similarity to viruses recently circulating in India. The virus is significantly different from those that have been circulating in China up to the last case in 1994. Further genomic sequencing work is proceeding.   A combined MOH/WHO/UNICEF/JICA mission visited Qinghai Province from 20-25 December 1999 to review the response to the case. Initial case response immunization has been carried out, achieving high coverage of the target group. Extensive additional activities are planned, including large scale immunization across several provinces, intensified surveillance, retrospective review of hospital records at all levels in several provinces,and active search for cases of acute flaccid paralysis.

The park is in a forested area where yellow fever is known to be endemic, thus these cases resulted from sylvatic transmission.   Two of the cases were in residents of Brasilia (one fatal case) and 1 case was in Rio de Janeiro. Because the cases were recognized in non-endemic urban areas where Aedes aegypti mosquitoes are present, immunization programmes and vector control measures are being carried out in both cities to avoid any potential urban transmission.

Laboratory testing carried out at the Centre International de Recherches Médicales de Franceville (CIRMF) in Gabon indicates that the cause of the haemorrhagic fever outbreak is the Ebola virus. For Gabon, this is the fourth Ebola outbreak since 1994. All outbreaks have been in the central and northeastern regions of the country.   As of 12 December 2001, WHO has received reports of 10 deaths from haemorrhagic fever among a total of 12 suspected cases.   The Gabon Ministry of Health has established a national task force for managing the response to the epidemic. WHO is supporting the Ministry of Health and this Task Force in disease containment by:   coordinating the international response to the outbreak,   implementing disease control measures, such as barrier nursing procedures,   finding cases, tracing contacts and monitoring them, and   supplying protective equipment.   Dr Ray Arthur, an expert virologist, and a team of three colleagues from WHO headquarters in Geneva, Dr Adamou Yada from the WHO African Regional Office, together with Dr Herve Zeller from Institute Pasteur in Paris, France, have arrived in Gabon. Other partners in the Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network are expected to arrive soon in Gabon.    WHO and its partners will work with the Gabonese authorities to contain the disease and to prevent any potential spread in local communities. It is very important that there is an effective and coordinated international response to this outbreak,  said Dr Mike Ryan, Coordinator of Global Alert and Response at WHO headquarters.   Ebola haemorrhagic fever is one of the most virulent viral diseases known to humankind, causing death in 50-90% of cases. The Ebola virus is transmitted by direct contact with the blood or body fluids of infected persons. The Ebola virus was first identified in 1976 in the western equatorial province of Sudan and in the nearby region of Yambuku, northern Democratic Republic of the Congo, (then Zaire.)   Gabon's first verified Ebola outbreak occurred in December 1994 in gold mining encampments. Investigators studying the outbreak were told of unexplained deaths of great apes, gorillas and chimpanzees, but no dead animals were found. The outbreak ended six weeks later.   Two other Ebola epidemics were confirmed in the spring and fall of 1996. In early February, about 40 km south (seven hours by boat) from the 1994 outbreak, 13 people became ill after butchering a dead chimpanzee they had found. In October of that year, another Ebola epidemic was confirmed in the same general region.   ______________________________________   For more information on Ebola haemorrhagic fever in Gabon, please see previous report .

We have received reports about unexpected cases of anthrax, initially from the United States and now from elsewhere. Dr Gro Harlem Brundtland, Director-General of WHO said,  Local and national public health systems are gearing up to respond to outbreaks of infectious disease, whether deliberate or naturally occurring. There are three lessons from recent events: first, public health systems have responded promptly to the suspicion of deliberate infections; second, these systems must continue to be vigilant; and third, an informed and responsible public is a critical part of the response. Today we are releasing revised guidance on responses to suspected anthrax infections.    Anthrax is not a new disease and it is completely curable following a correct and rapid diagnosis. Although anthrax is an extremely serious condition, the most dangerous form - inhalation or pulmonary anthrax - can only be caught by direct exposure to spores suspended in the air. It is not possible to catch inhalation anthrax from another person.   Dr David Heymann, Executive Director for Communicable Diseases, WHO Geneva headquarters, said,  We would like it to be possible for citizens in all countries to understand how best to respond to the deliberate use of anthrax. Anyone who feels ill should seek medical advice in the normal way. Unless they have been directly exposed to anthrax spores, they cannot have anthrax and should not be concerned. Anyone who receives or sees a suspicious letter or package should report it to the police or other local authorities in the normal way. In many countries, police and health authorities are equipped to test and react to any suspicious package and whatever it might contain.    It is vital that people should not attempt to use antibiotics to treat or protect themselves without first seeking medical advice. Antibiotics are powerful and effective tools, but must be used correctly and wisely. If the wrong antibiotics are used, they will not be effective and could possibly cause harm. Misuse can also lead to drug resistance, which means that even the most powerful antibiotics can lose their ability to treat disease. At this stage, widespread immunization against anthrax is not a feasible option.   WHO is working with national governments and international bodies to monitor the situation and provide updated guidance at regular intervals.  "

A second man, a co-worker, presented himself to medical authorities who positively identified anthrax bacteria in his nose. The two men worked at a local newspaper office in Boca Raton, Florida. One of the many samples taken from their workplace environment was positive for anthrax bacteria. Final results from other environmental samples will not be available for several days. Nonetheless, CDC assessed the risk to other employees and visitors as extremely low.  An epidemiological investigation on this event is ongoing and WHO will continue to be updated.   Pulmonary or inhalational anthrax is very rare in the United States. There were 18 reported cases in the 20 th Century with the last case some 25 years ago. Anthrax is not contagious. Anthrax bacteria normally enter the human species from infected animals or animal products, such as from eating infected meat, or through occupational exposure, such as in tannery workers. Symptoms of pulmonary anthrax include fever, muscle aches, and fatigue that rapidly progress to severe systemic disease. Antibiotic treatment before symptoms occur will prevent the disease.  Anthrax vaccines can prevent infection, but are not normally recommended for the general public.  "

Cases of yellow fever have been confirmed in five of the ten communes in Abidjan; suspected cases have also been reported elsewhere. In all, 20 suspected cases have been notified in Abidjan, including four deaths; six of the cases have been confirmed and several others are under investigation.   Surveillance data is by no means comprehensive and all indications are that the real situation could be considerably more serious than the number of cases officially suggests. There is also an incubation period of three to seven days before symptoms begin to appear.   Urban Yellow Fever is spread by a variety of mosquito that lives in or very close to people's homes and, although very rare, can spread extremely rapidly among a dense urban population, causing many thousands of deaths. Rapid action is essential to purchase stocks of vaccine and deliver them to Abidjan as soon as possible, to prevent this worrying outbreak from becoming a humanitarian disaster.   WHO has received an appeal for assistance from the government of the Republic of Côte d'Ivoire, following confirmation of the first cases in Abidjan. The government has asked for WHO's assistance in mobilizing international funds to provide financial and technical aid.    WHO is today appealing to the international community to provide urgent assistance in the purchase and supply of vaccine. WHO will support all the measures necessary to bring this potential human tragedy to a swift conclusion,  said Dr David Heymann, WHO Executive Director for Communicable Diseases.   A WHO Rapid Assessment Team is in Abidjan, working with the Ministry of Public Health to formulate a response to the outbreak. Plans are under way for a mass immunization campaign in Abidjan, requiring some three million doses of vaccine. WHO is urgently locating stocks of yellow fever vaccine that can be moved quickly to Côte d'Ivoire.   In Abidjan, immunization teams will have to be recruited, trained and provided with the necessary resources and logistic support for this huge but vital undertaking. There is a delay of 7-10 days from immunization until protective immunity develops. It is therefore crucial for this campaign to begin as soon as possible in order to protect the population from an epidemic.   Yellow fever is endemic in some tropical areas of Africa and the Americas. However, it is most commonly found in jungle areas and spread only sporadically to humans entering the forest.   When the virus spreads into urban areas with high population density, it immediately becomes a very serious public health risk. Yellow fever is difficult to recognize in its early stages, when it can easily be confused with malaria, typhoid or other causes of fever. However, a number of cases enter a second  toxic phase  of the disease, in which bleeding can occur from the mouth, nose, eyes and/or stomach. Approximately 20-50% of  toxic  cases die within 10-14 days.    The international community must respond and respond quickly to this urgent appeal to prevent a catastrophic outbreak of yellow fever in Abidjan,  added Dr Heymann.

The first patient presented with symptoms on 26 July, while the latest case presented with symptoms on 1 September. All the patients had visited a limited area of the centre of Stavanger within ten days of the onset of symptoms.   Local health authorities in collaboration with NIPH have identified several possible sources of legionellosis within this area, including a water fountain situated in a park and several cooling towers. Results from samples taken from these possible sources are pending. The fountain in question has been closed down and all cooling towers in the vicinity have been disinfected.

Two of the cases occurred in January 2001, before the main period of pilgrimage to Saudi Arabia. N. meningitidis serogroup W135 has been laboratory confirmed.   United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland: 41 cases (8 pilgrims returning from the Haj, 19 cases of close contacts and data outstanding on the remaining cases) including 11 deaths of laboratory confirmed invasive N. meningitidis serogroup W135 have been reported.   Meningococcal disease. As with all types of meningococcal disease, early diagnosis and treatment are essential. The symptoms of group W135 meningococcal disease are the same as for other groups of the disease: sudden onset of intense headache, high fever, nausea, and vomiting, photophobia and stiff neck. The most severe clinical form of the disease, meningococcal septicaemia can be presented by abrupt onset, high fever, petechial rash or purpura.   WHO recommends that chemoprophylaxis be given to close contacts of the cases, such as persons sleeping in the same dwelling. In most countries rifampicin is recommended.   In preparation for the Umrah and the Haj seasons for next year, the Ministry of Health of the Government of Saudi Arabia has notified the Ministries of Health of all countries from which pilgrims arrive, that the vaccination against meningococcal meningitis with the quadrivalent vaccine (serogroups A,C, Y and W135) has been added to the health requirements for arrivals coming to the Umrah and Haj.

For further information, click on the website of the Government of Hong Kong       Special Administrative Region of China .  The following is the transcript of the       English portion of the opening remarks made by Mrs Lily Yam, the Secretary for the       Environment and Food, Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of China, at a press       briefing held on May 16:  Precautionary measures taken to prevent       spread of chicken disease  I have called this press briefing to       announce that at 3.30 this afternoon the Director of Agriculture, Fisheries and       Conservation has issued a notice declaring the poultry stalls in three markets as infected       places in accordance with the Public Health (Animals and Birds) Regulations. The three       markets are Yeung Luk Road Market in Sheung Wan, Fa Yuen Street Market, and the Smithfield       Road Market.  The Food and Environmental Hygiene       Department has already started action to close these poultry stalls and the department has       requested all poultry stallholders to destroy the live birds in their stalls, and these       stallholders will be given every assistance and advice by members of the Food and       Environmental Hygiene Department. The department has also made appropriate arrangements       for the destroyed birds to be sent right away to a landfill for proper treatment. After       all the birds have been destroyed, the poultry stalls in the markets will be thoroughly       cleansed and disinfected.  We have taken this precautionary measure       for two reasons. The first is that since yesterday, in Yeung Luk Road Market, 763 chickens       have died. There are also a number of chicken deaths in the other two markets. Tests by       the Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department have demonstrated that these       chickens have died of avian influenza. I have to emphasize that there are many strains of       H5N1 and according to the information currently available, only the H5N1 chicken strain       that we had in Hong Kong in 1997 would affect human beings, and the vast majority of H5N1       strains will not affect human beings.  From samples we have recently collected       from these three markets, a few are shown to contain the H5 virus, and genes sequencing       tests have demonstrated that these viruses are not - I repeat not - the same as the kind       of H5N1 chicken virus that we had in Hong Kong in 1997. Nonetheless, we feel that it is       essential for us to take this precautionary measure because there is a need to destroy       these viruses thoroughly, to prevent their lingering in the market always with the       probability, no matter how low the possibility, that they might - they might - combine       with other viruses to result in a new strain which may affect human beings.  I have to reiterate there is no cause for       public concern at this stage. This is a precautionary measure. The indication is that       there is no evidence that these viruses would affect human beings. Of course, the public       is reminded to observe the usual hygiene standards.  The measures that we have taken and the       tests that we have conducted, and the results, show that in Hong Kong we have one of the       best and thorough surveillance systems covering not just imported birds but also the       arrangements in our markets, and the public can rest assured that this surveillance system       will enable us to detect any problems as soon as they arise so that we can take the       necessary measures.  Thank you very much.   "

The last person to be infected by the virus     recovered 42 days ago, twice the maximum incubation period for Ebola to develop.  The international response, in support of     the Government of Uganda helped to break the cycle of transmission of the virus which     killed 224 people in Uganda, including health workers and Dr. Matthew Lukwiya, who first     identified the outbreak.  More than 20 international NGOs and     government agencies ( see list below ) from WHO's Global Outbreak     Alert and Response Network worked together to combat the outbreak. In particular, the     Centres for Disease Control and Prevention, US (CDC), Epicentre, Health Canada, Italian     Cooperation, Médecins sans Frontières (MSF), the Red Cross and UNICEF, together with     institutions in Belgium, Germany, Japan and the United Kingdom worked closely with the     doctors, nurses and staff at Gulu Hospital and Lacor Hospital, and Ugandan government     officials.   The successful operation in Uganda     emphasized what can be achieved when we identify epidemic threats rapidly and act together     swiftly. Today we recognize the efforts of the people of Uganda, and the contributions and     achievements of our partners.  says David Heymann, Executive Director of WHO's     Communicable Diseases.  Epidemic prone diseases are harmful to communities and ignore     national borders. We need to recognize them as threats to global health security and     coordinate effective international solutions.   In this regard, WHO is working to mobilize     the international community to strengthen epidemic alert and response and raise awareness     of the global threat of infectious diseases. Global health security will be a top agenda     item at this year's World Health Assembly.  First reports from Gulu District of an     unusual severe febrile illness reached the Ugandan Ministry of Health in Kampala on 8     October 2000. Even before the disease was formally identified as Ebola, the Government of     Uganda facilitated rapid access to the outbreak area and partners in WHO's Global     Outbreak Alert and Response Network responded with technical experts, protective equipment     and logistics support for the Outbreak Response.  Initial laboratory confirmation was carried out by the     National Institute of Virology in South Africa. A field laboratory was maintained at Lacor     Hospital by CDC throughout the outbreak. This innovative measure guaranteed essential     laboratory services for diagnostic tests to confirm or refute Ebola infection, and for     packaging and transport of clinical samples requiring additional investigations.  Direct financial support to the Ebola     Appeal was provided by Canada, ECHO, the European Commission, Ireland, Norway and Japan to     supplement contingency funding provided by Germany and the Netherlands. In addition, many     donors and agencies provided assistance directly to Uganda.  The mobilization of the local community in     Gulu played a pivotal role in controlling the Ebola outbreak and is central to a new     early-warning surveillance system for epidemic-prone diseases. Following the Ebola     Outbreak partners in WHO's Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network and     Uganda's Ministry of Health are implementing a community-based disease surveillance     system that will significantly improve people's lives and represents a potential model for     future development of community-based surveillance systems.  Ebola haemorrhagic fever (EHF) is one of     the most virulent viral diseases known to humankind, causing death in 50-90% of all     clinically ill cases. The virus was first identified in a western equatorial province of     Sudan and in a nearby region of Zaire (now Democratic Republic of the Congo) in 1976 after     significant epidemics in Yambuku, northern Zaire, and Nzara, southern Sudan.  Including the most recent outbreak, about     1500 cases with over 1000 deaths have been documented since the virus was discovered.

"2002","http://www.who.int/csr/don/2002_08_30/en/index.html"," 2002 - Influenza in Madagascar - Update 6   30 August 2002  Disease Outbreak Reported   The international team from the Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network assisting the Ministry of Health provided a preliminary report of their findings and recommendations to the Ministry of Health on 29 August.   Summary: An epidemic of influenza was attributed to influenza A/Panama/2007/99like (H3N2) viruses that impacted the populations of the highlands region of Fianarantsoa Province. This is the same strain that was associated with influenza epidemics worldwide during 2001-02. The most affected area of the province was Ikongo district. The observed increase in excess mortality compared to previous years appeared to be due to widespread transmission and not an especially virulent influenza strain. Most deaths occurred outside of health facilities and disproportionately affected young children. Seasonal epidemics of influenza that have been documented in Antananarivo most likely also affect the highlands region of Fianarantsoa Province each winter, resulting in morbidity and mortality.   Among the  recommendations are: expanding the influenza sentinel surveillance system and implementing a standard case definition for influenza-like illness; improving case management and training for health care providers; and providing health education activities to inform the public about influenza and the need for those at high risk (young children,the elderly and those with chronic illness) to seek medical care if experiencing acute respiratory illness.   "

The international team from the Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network continues to work with mobile teams from the Ministry of Health investigating these cases and collecting samples. Since the beginning of August 2002, additional influenza A(H3N2) viruses have been isolated from cases in different provinces. Analysis by the WHO Collaborating Centre for Reference and Research on Influenza in London, United Kingdom and the Institut Pasteur, Madagascar (National Influenza Centre) have shown that the circulating influenza virus is similar to A(H3N2) viruses   (A/Panama/2007/99/(H3N2) ) which have been circulating in the northern and southern hemispheres for several years. The virus circulating in Madagascar is similar to those included in the current influenza vaccine and also in the vaccine for the coming influenza season in the northern hemisphere; these vaccines, therefore, protect against infection with this virus.     "

Neglected but treatable diseases have taken hold throughout this long history of conflict and defeated the efforts of doctors and clinics to bring them under control.   One of the most serious examples is a disfiguring disease known by various names including Kandahar sore (scientific name cutaneous leishmaniasis). This is a condition caused by a parasite transmitted by insect bites that leads to disfiguring facial injuries and long-term disability. As a result, those affected are often stigmatized.   Women and children are particularly affected and in some cases women may be treated as outcasts by their communities. In some areas, the disease is so widespread that it is known as  Little Sister  because it is almost a part of the family. But in Kabul today there is an opportunity to bring it under control and end the suffering endured by so many people.   Two hundred thousand people are believed to be infected with this parasite in Kabul alone. Due to their lower levels of resistance to the disease, returning refugees and other displaced persons in Kabul are at higher risk of infection. International staff working in Afghanistan also face a substantially higher risk.   The World Health Organization, together with the government of Afghanistan and a number of international NGOs, is launching an urgent appeal for funds to bring this serious outbreak under control. This is one case where a remarkably small amount of money could make an enormous difference.    A little over one million dollars is all we need to fund a two-year programme that would have a huge, long-term impact on this disfiguring disease once and for all,  said Dr Gro Harlem Brundtland, Director-General of the WHO.  But we need to act now: if this opportunity is missed, there will be a severe increase in the number of cases next year.    It is vital that this emergency response is launched as soon as possible. Because this form of leishmaniasis is passed from person to person via the bite of a sandfly, the infection can spread rapidly in a concentrated population, particularly among the poor. The sandflies breed quickly in unsanitary conditions. After biting an infected person, the sandflies spread the disease each time they bite.   Transmission occurs from May to October, but new cases may not emerge for another several months because of the long incubation period of the disease. However, it is vital to interrupt transmission in order to avoid a sharp increase in the number of cases over the next year. A rapid response now also allows a long-term control plan to be put in place, to prevent this disease from taking an even stronger hold in Afghanistan.   The WHO emergency plan involves a rapid intervention combining preventive and curative measures with drugs for mass treatment, insecticide impregnated bednets for individual protection, social mobilization, and health education to ensure that this disabling disease of poverty can be brought under control.

Although CL is not a lethal disease, it carries a high burden of social stigma. Movements of populations both within the country and across borders due to the consequences of ongoing conflicts are expected to increase the incidence of the disease within the coming months. CL has been endemic in Afghanistan for several years, with foci of zoonotic (animal reservoir to man) transmission mainly in the northern provinces and with anthroponotic transmission (human to human) typically involving large cities.   An emergency plan of action is being developed by WHO and other partners to control the situation by the end of 2003, at least in Kabul. Priority interventions include provision of impregnated bednets, early treatment of cases with first line drugs, recruitment and training of intervention teams, and health education.   WHO has already provided drugs for the treatment of 35 000 cases.  In collaboration with HNI, WHO has also provided impregnated bednets for protection against the sandfly vector.      "

A vaccination campaign had been undertaken in three woredas (districts) in Sidama Zone, but there have been localized epidemics and an increase in the number of cases reported from other districts and zones in the Region.   In response, the Federal Ministry of Health has re-activated the Task Force on Epidemic Meningococcal Disease for the current epidemic season.  The Task Force consists of WHO, Médecins sans Frontières (MSF- France, Holland, Switzerland and Belgium), International Federation of the Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, Ethiopian Red Cross, United States Agency for International Development (USAID), UNICEF and European Union Humanitarian Office (ECHO); it is working to coordinate control activities including surveillance, case management, vaccination campaigns and logistics.   SNNPR is one of the biggest regions in Ethiopia, with an estimated population of over 12.5 million people. The high population density, current dry season and low immunization coverage exacerbate the potential for a major meningitis epidemic.   To prevent this from becoming a reality, the Ministry of Health on behalf of the Task Force is urgently appealing for funds to carry out a mass immunization campaign in 5 priority zones in SNNPR: Hadia, Sidama, Gedeo, North Omo and South Omo.  The total target population (aged 2-30) is estimated at 5 568 506.

The suspected SARS case in southern China remains a suspected case.   Laboratory experts from the Ministry of Health of China, top scientific institutes in Beijing and WHO have reviewed the latest test results carried out on the patient in Guangzhou, and have determined that the results remain inconclusive.   Consequently, experts recommend that further tests are needed.   The Ministry of Health of China has decided that samples will be sent to a laboratory that is part of the WHO international reference network. WHO believes that carrying out tests at multiple laboratories enhances the testing process.   Meanwhile, the epidemiological investigation continues in Guangdong province. A team of international experts from WHO are on a joint mission there with the Ministry of Health of China and the Chinese Centre for Disease Control and Prevention.   The male patient, a 32-year-old television producer, remains isolated in hospital. His condition is said to be good, and his temperature has been normal for the past several days.   All his relevant human contacts identified so far are well. Some have already been removed from medical observation. Others remain in quarantine, but are expected to be released over the next few days, as the 14-day observation period mandated by China’s health authorities draws to a close.   Ever since informing WHO about the case on December 26, 2003, the Ministry of Health of China and the Chinese Centre for Disease Control and Prevention have met daily with WHO officials, and provided WHO with a comprehensive list of information, including the patient’s clinical history and test results.   WHO will continue to provide information regularly on this case, as the tests and investigation progress in the coming days.  "

In other European countries (Portugal, Spain and the United Kingdom) and most parts of Canada, activity has declined.   Most influenza infections this season have been attributed to influenza A(H3N2) viruses. The majority of viruses antigenically characterized so far have been shown to be A/Fujian/411/2002-like; the rest have been A/Panama/2007/99-like. There have been few reports of influenza A/Fujian/411/2002-like virus detections from Asia. Influenza A(H1) and B viruses have also been detected in some countries. Both B/Hong Kong/330/2001-like and B/Sichuan/379/99-like viruses have been identified. The hemagglutinins of all influenza A(H1) viruses characterized so far have been A/New Caledonia/20/99-like.   An avian influenza A(H5N1) outbreak in poultry in a chicken farm in the Republic of Korea was reported on Tuesday 16 December. The outbreak was recognized by the death of about 19 000 chickens. Surviving chickens in the affected farm were slaughtered. As of Monday 22 December 2003, nine poultry farms in 4 provinces were found to be infected by avian influenza. About one million chickens and ducks are to be culled. The A(H5N1) strain isolated is being examined to determine its relation to other influenza A(H5N1) viruses, which emerged in Asia recently. So far no human A(H5N1) cases have been reported.   Additional investigation of a recent influenza A(H9N2) case in Hong Kong SAR China is on going to determine the source of infection. Virus isolates have been sent to the WHO Collaborating Centers for Reference and Research on Influenza for sequencing and antigenic makeup characterising to update the diagnostic reagents available for National Influenza Centers . So far all further results of investigation appear to confirm the initial findings that this is an isolated case.   For previous update  For more information: WHO Influenza web site   Canada . During week 50, widespread activity of influenza was reported in British Columbia and Ontario, while localised or sporadic activity was reported in most of other parts of Canada. The influenza-like illness (ILI) consultation rate was 52 cases per 1000 consultations, which is below the baseline. During this week, 17% of 3983 laboratory tests were positive for influenza A and no influenza B virus was detected.

Influenza activity has continued to increase during November in Canada, Finland, France, Israel, Norway, Portugal, Spain, the United Kingdom (UK) and the United States of America (USA).   In Europe (Ireland, Norway, Portugal, Spain, Switzerland), most H3N2 viruses that have been characterized antigenically so far this season were A/Fujian/411/2002-like; in the UK, 2/3 of isolates characterized so far were A/Fujian/411/2002-like and one third were A/Panama/2007/99-like. In Canada, more than a half of the A(H3N2) isolates characterized so far are A/Fujian/411/2002-like, while the rest were A/Panama/2007/99-like. In the US, more than ¾ of the A(H3N2) isolates were A/Fujian/411/2002-like; the rest are A/Panama/2007/99-like.   In the last eight weeks, five deaths in children, two in England and three in Scotland, have been confirmed as due to A/Fujian/411/2002-like virus.   A/Fujian/411/2002-like strains are drift variants of the A/Panama/2007/99 vaccine virus. Therefore antibodies produced against the A/Panama/2007/99-like strain(see WER 2003 78(9): 58-62 and WER 2003 87(11):77 ) do cross-react with A/Fujian/411/2002-like strains, but at a lower level.   For example, in laboratory tests of sera from recipients of influenza vaccines currently used in the northern hemisphere, there were on average 41% reductions in the post-immunization antibody titres to A/Fujian/411/2002-like strains, when compared with the A/Panama/2007/99 vaccine strain. However despite such reductions, the tests demonstrated that 76% of adult and 72% of the elderly vaccinees possessed protective levels of antibody(HI titres of >40) to A/Fujian/411/2002-like strains.

"2003","http://www.who.int/csr/don/2003_09_24/en/index.html"," Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in Singapore - update 2  SARS case in Singapore linked to accidental laboratory contamination   24 September 2003 Disease Outbreak Reported   The Singapore Ministry of Health has released the full report of an international investigation of a recent SARS case. The investigation, which followed laboratory confirmation on 8 September of SARS in a 27-year-old researcher, concluded that the patient most likely acquired the infection in a laboratory as the result of accidental contamination. The investigation found no evidence of further transmission and no reason to regard this single isolated case as a concern for international public health.   The case in Singapore marked the first case of SARS to be confirmed since the last known case in the world was detected and isolated in Taiwan, China, on 15 June. In addition to positive results in the laboratory tests for the SARS coronavirus, the SARS agent, subsequently confirmed by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Singapore patient showed clinical signs consistent with a diagnosis of SARS.   The patient was conducting research on the West Nile virus in a laboratory that was also conducting research using active SARS coronavirus. The investigation concluded that cross-contamination of West Nile virus samples with the SARS virus in the laboratory was the source of infection. Both viruses were detected in a research specimen.   The genetic sequence of the SARS coronavirus isolated from the infected patient was found to be closely related to the sequence of the laboratory strain, further supporting the likelihood that infection was the result of accidental laboratory contamination.   The investigation was conducted by an 11-member panel including experts from Singapore, WHO Western Pacific Regional Office and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The investigation found no evidence that the patient was a carrier of the SARS virus, acquired during some past contact with a SARS patient, or that any other chain of person-to-person transmission was the cause of the infection. Research on the SARS virus in Singapore is conducted in biosafety level 3 facilities. However, the experts identified several inappropriate laboratory practices that contributed to the accident, and made a series of recommendations for their correction. The laboratory where the accident occurred has been temporarily closed. The panel viewed the incident as an opportunity for Singapore to improve biosafety in its laboratories by introducing uniform standards of safety and improving the training of staff.   Biosafety level 3 facilities are designed for work with Risk Group 3 microorganisms, as defined in the WHO Laboratory Biosafety Manual, Edition 2.5 . Biosafety level 3 containment requires special engineering and design features as well as heightened safety standards and practices.   The possibility that a SARS outbreak could occur following a laboratory accident is a risk of considerable importance, given the relatively large number of laboratories currently conducting research using the SARS coronavirus or retaining specimens from SARS patients.   The investigation found that the case in Singapore was rapidly detected by surveillance procedures in place at Singapore General Hospital and appropriate clinical management and infection control practices were implemented. The swift detection of this case illustrates the importance of continued global vigilance for SARS. This is especially needed in areas that were affected by SARS, and in all institutions that have retained virus isolates and/or diagnostic specimens from SARS patients. It also highlights the importance of strict adherence to appropriate laboratory biosafety procedures and practices for work with communicable agents, such as the SARS coronavirus.   The full report of the review panel is available at:   In response to this incident and the findings of the review panel, WHO is currently evaluating its recommendations on the storage and handling of the SARS agent.

"2003","http://www.who.int/csr/don/2003_09_16/en/index.html"," Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in Singapore - update   16 September 2003 Disease Outbreak Reported   In Singapore, the 27-year-old medical researcher who worked in a virology laboratory is now considered a WHO laboratory-confirmed case of SARS coronavirus (CoV) infection.   Laboratory results from the case, which was first identified by Singapore health authorities, have now been confirmed by another laboratory in the SARS network, in this case by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control. WHO hopes that when such sporadic cases arise they will be independently confirmed by an external laboratory in the SARS laboratory network.   The patient developed fever, was hospitalized, isolated and his fever has now resolved. Contacts have been traced and all continue to be healthy. Singapore officials have notified WHO that the patient will be released Wednesday and placed in home quarantine for 14 days.   The Singapore case is mild, isolated and has not produced secondary cases, and therefore is not regarded as an international public health concern.   In relation to SARS, Singapore continues to be a safe destination for travellers, and travellers from Singapore pose no risk to other countries.   Speculation about the source of the patient’s infection has centered on a workplace exposure in a Singapore laboratory.   However, an international team of experts began work today examining laboratory safety issues surrounding the case. An 11-member panel, chaired by Dr. Antony Della-Porta, an Australian biosafety expert, will review lab safety issues in Singapore and make recommendations. The panel’s investigation is expected to be completed next week.   Internationally, WHO will be addressing the issue of laboratory safety at its meeting of SARS scientific advisors next month in Geneva.  "
"2003","http://www.who.int/csr/don/2003_09_10/en/index.html"," Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in Singapore   10 September 2003 Disease Outbreak Reported   Singapore has a laboratory-confirmed case of SARS coronavirus (CoV) infection. This single case is in a 27-year-old postgraduate medical student who worked in a virology laboratory in Singapore. The patient developed fever, was hospitalized, isolated and his fever has now resolved. Contact tracing is continuing but it has not identified any secondary cases arising from this infection.   It is well recognized that most viruses can cause a range of illness from mild to severe. The goal of WHO’s SARS guidance in the post-outbreak period is to rapidly identify threats to global public health. Consequently, WHO’s case definitions are designed to provide early warning and give health officials direction for responding to a new outbreak of SARS. The Singapore case is mild, isolated and has not produced secondary cases, and therefore is not regarded as a public health concern.   WHO continues to applaud Singapore’s public health officials for the openness with which they have responded to this event and the rapid precautions taken to contain a possible threat.   Since there is a suggestion that this case may have resulted from a laboratory accident, WHO will be addressing the issue of laboratory safety at its meeting of SARS scientific advisors next month in Geneva.   To conclude, in relation to SARS, Singapore continues to be a safe destination for travellers, and travellers from Singapore pose no risk to other countries.   This event is not an international public health concern.  "
"2003","http://www.who.int/csr/don/2003_09_02/en/index.html"," Cholera in Liberia - Update 5   2 September 2003 Disease Outbreak Reported   On the basis of the assessment team's visit and analysis of the data ( see previous report ), WHO has now reported a cumulative number of 6353 cases since the beginning of the outbreak in Monrovia in June until 17 August.  Systematic reporting of deaths from cholera has not been undertaken in health centres.  WHO has put an emergency surveillance system in place to fill this gap. The first peak reached 935 cases during 7-13 July. The weekly average decreased by end July -early August, although the  worsening security situation prevented cholera patients from attending  health care facilities. Since the ceasefire and the improvement in security, the number of registered cases  has been rapidly increasing.  According to figures collected at cholera treatment centres in Monrovia, there were 727 registered cases during 4-10 August and 1203 cases during11-17 August. More people are now returning to their homes or  to refugee camps outside Monrovia; as a result, the cholera outbreak is spreading  from  central Monrovia to peripheral areas of the city and neighbouring districts. There are approximately 230 000 people in  internally  displaced   persons  camps in Monrovia living in very difficult conditions. The sanitation is poor and safe water is scarce with only 2 litres per day per person available.  In order to reduce the risk of waterborne diseases and to limit cholera transmission, WHO, in collaboration  with UNICEF and other partners, has launched a campaign for the chlorination of water in Monrovia. The chlorination of 5000 open wells in the city has begun and the process will be repeated regularly until the cholera risk has diminished. Nutrition screening carried out  by nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) found that 40 % of the children screened are suffering from acute malnutrition which may increase the rate of severe cholera cases. Médecins sans Frontières France and Belgium and MERLIN have opened cholera treatment centres near the most affected areas. The Cholera Coordination Committee has been reactivated to ensure the effectiveness of the efforts of partners (Ministry of Health, WHO, NGOs) operating in Liberia during this post-war phase. In particular, NGOs have been encouraged to better inform the population on cholera preventive measures.  "

Preliminary epidemiological data indicate that 74% of the cases were aged 5 to 14. Samples received by the Central Laboratory in Kabul confirm C.diptheriae. Further laboratory investigations are ongoing in Islamabad, Pakistan.   A mass vaccination campaign targeting the entire population of the camp (c. 40,000) was launched on 2 August 2003. As of 7 August 2003, 7,544 individuals had received vaccine.   WHO, UNHCR, UNICEF, Médecins sans Frontières-Holland, International Committee of the Red Cross, International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies and Inter-SOS are assisting the Ministry of Health in the implementation of control activities and in the provision of drugs, antitoxin, and vaccine supplies as well as technical and logistic support.

"2003","http://www.who.int/csr/don/2003_08_25a/en/index.html"," Outbreak in British Columbia, Canada is not SARS   25 August 2003   An outbreak of respiratory illness in an aged care facility in Canada has now been extensively investigated for SARS and WHO concludes the disease is not SARS.   On 14 August, Canadian public health officials reported to WHO that an unidentified respiratory disease in a Surrey, British Columbia health care facility had infected 143 residents and staff. Some initial testing suggested the SARS coronavirus may have played a role.   Now, WHO and Canadian health authorities have gathered enough evidence to conclude that the outbreak in British Columbia is not SARS. Analysis from laboratories in Canada and the United States did not confirm the initial concern that SARS had mutated into a milder disease.   Two lines of evidence have converged to dismiss the SARS concern.   Clinically, the disease itself was strikingly different from the SARS outbreak in the spring. The features of the current outbreak included a low case fatality, runny nose, lack of fever in most patients, and no SARS-like changes in the lung seen on X-ray.   Now, sequencing of a portion of the virus causing the outbreak has led to the finding that it was not the SARS coronavirus but another human coronavirus known as OC43. This virus, which is one of the causes of the common cold, has been associated with respiratory outbreaks in aged care facilities in other countries.   In terms of SARS, Canada continues to be a safe destination for travellers and travellers from Canada pose no exceptional risk to other countries.   This outbreak has no international public health implications.  "

Since the beginning of June, 2464 cholera cases have been registered. These figures do not include mild cases for which data is not currently available, and underestimates the number of cases for the months of June, July and August. To date, the number of deaths is unobtainable.   This epidemiological information is based on data provided by Médecins sans Frontières Belgium and France and MERLIN who have been working in Monrovia during the outbreak.   As reported previously, it is likely that an increase in cases will occur in the coming weeks because of the movement of people, overcrowded living conditions in central Monrovia and the lack of safe water.

Data on the number of cases and deaths is very difficult to obtain ( see previous report ).   There have been cholera outbreaks in previous years in Monrovia, especially during the rainy season. However, at the start of the outbreak in early June this year there were approximately 200 cases per week, compared with 30 cases per week during the same period in 2001 and 2002.   In July 2003, there were 350 severe cases per week; during the week of 11-18 August, there were 240 severe cases of cholera. The number of cases is likely to increase in the near future because of the movement of population and the lack of safe water. The increased level of malnutrition has also added to the risk of more severe cases of cholera.   Working with partners, WHO plans to reactivate the cholera control committee, disseminate health education material and work to mass cholrinate wells as soon as possible.  "

"2003","http://www.who.int/csr/don/2003_07_05/en/index.html"," Update 96 - Taiwan, China: SARS transmission interrupted in last outbreak area   5 July   WHO is today removing Taiwan from its list of areas with recent local transmission of SARS. This achievement means that all known chains of person-to-person transmission of the SARS virus have now been broken.   “With the last known chain of transmission interrupted in Taiwan, the whole world can breathe an initial sigh of relief,” said Dr David Heymann, the WHO Executive Director for communicable diseases. “At the same time, public health must not let down its guard, as more cases could still surface somewhere in the world. SARS has taught us that a single case is capable of igniting an outbreak.”   “Taiwan was unlucky. A lapse in infection control in a single hospital allowed the outbreak, which had been under good control, to escalate. But the authorities reacted quickly and appropriately. In doing so, they have also strengthened capacity to deal with any future outbreaks.”   The last reported probable case in Taiwan, and – for the moment – in the world, was detected and isolated on 15 June. Two consecutive 10-day incubation periods have now passed with no further cases detected.   The achievement comes just slightly more than four months since the virus began moving around the world, in late February, along the routes of international air travel.   Taiwan’s first case of SARS occurred in a 54-year-old businessman with a travel history, in late February, to Guangdong Province, China, where the earliest cases of SARS are now known to have occurred. The businessman was hospitalized on 8 March.   Taiwan eventually had to cope with the third largest outbreak on record, including 674 cases and 84 deaths. The largest outbreaks occurred in mainland China (5327 cases and 348 deaths) and Hong Kong (1755 cases and 298 deaths).   The outbreak in Taiwan initially grew slowly, with only 23 probable cases detected in the first month. Of these, a single health care worker, a doctor, became infected when he treated the wife of the businessman. All of the earliest cases could be directly linked to close contact with a SARS patient, or had a history of recent travel to an area where local transmission was known to be occurring. Only 4 of the early cases resulted from secondary spread within Taiwan.   The outbreak began to escalate in mid-April following a lapse in infection control procedures, which allowed the disease to spread rapidly within the hospital setting and then into the wider community. In dealing with the emergency that followed, health authorities rapidly introduced a series of sweeping measures. The surveillance system was upgraded and began to deliver the kind of information needed for prompt and targeted action. Hospital procedures for infection control were tightened, and a logistics system was developed to ensure the efficient delivery of protective equipment and other supplies.   Mass education campaigns persuaded the population to check frequently for fever and report promptly at fever clinics, which greatly reduced the time between onset of symptoms and isolation of patients. The establishment of a mechanism for coordinating the response of all relevant sectors was another key to Taiwan’s success.   The global SARS outbreak developed quickly and dramatically, creating challenging and stressful demands on staff and health authorities at every outbreak site. The containment of SARS required heroic efforts and extraordinary measures that are difficult to sustain over time.   “Interruption of the last known chain of person-to-person transmission has come just in time. Health systems at every major outbreak site were strained to the limits of their capacity.” said Dr Heymann.   WHO continues to receive rumours of possible cases, which indicates that surveillance systems are working well. To date, all recently reported possible cases have been aggressively investigated and determined to have other causes. Failure to detect new cases over the next two weeks will greatly increase confidence that the SARS coronavirus has indeed been pushed out of its new human host, although a return of the disease cannot be ruled out completely on the basis of current knowledge.

"2003","http://www.who.int/csr/don/2003_07_03/en/index.html"," Update 94 – Preparing for the next influenza season in a world altered by SARS   3 July   As the global public health emergency caused by SARS appears close to an end, attention is focusing on the problems that are likely to arise during the next influenza season, when cases of influenza are likely to raise suspicions of SARS. The problems are of major concern, as a high level of suspicion is recommended by WHO at a time when vigilance for a possible seasonal return of SARS is particularly important.   Although the behaviour of the SARS virus is impossible to predict on the basis of current knowledge, it is well known that many respiratory illnesses caused by a virus tend to die out when heat and humidity rise and then return when the weather turns cooler.   Worldwide, influenza typically infects 10% to 20% of the total population during seasonal epidemics, resulting in from three to five million cases of severe illness and from 250 000 to 500 000 deaths.   Like SARS, influenza is known to have its highest mortality in persons over the age of 65 and in those already ill with certain chronic diseases.   The symptoms of influenza, which can include pneumonia in severe cases, are easily confused with those of SARS. The risk is therefore great that health systems around the world could be overburdened by suspected SARS cases, necessitating isolation, contact tracing, and quarantine of close contacts – all costly and socially disruptive measures.   The burden is all the greater in the absence of a rapid and convenient diagnostic test capable of ruling out SARS early in the course of illness and thus obviating the need for such measures.   For these reasons, WHO strongly recommends that all countries immunize at least health care workers, who are at greatest risk of both influenza and SARS, with the WHO-recommended influenza vaccine. If possible, the vaccine should also be given to elderly persons, especially when cared for in institutions, and other vulnerable populations, including persons with chronic cardiovascular disease.   WHO maintains a network of 112 influenza centres that continuously gather information on circulating influenza strains and epidemiological trends. Besides guiding the annual composition of recommended vaccines, the network operates as an early warning system for the emergence of influenza variants and novel strains that could signal the start of the next influenza pandemic.

"2003","http://www.who.int/csr/don/2003_07_02/en/index.html"," Update 93 – Toronto removed from list of areas with recent local transmission   2 July   WHO has today removed Toronto, Canada, from its list of areas with recent local transmission of SARS. The last probable case was detected on 12 June and immediately isolated. When 20 days, or twice the incubation period, have passed without detection of a new case, the chain of human-to-human transmission is considered broken.   “This is a great achievement for public health in what we hope is the final phase of the global emergency,” said David Heymann, the WHO Executive Director for communicable diseases. “Toronto faced an especially challenging outbreak. As we have learned, SARS is a difficult disease that produces many surprises and setbacks.”   “We should all pay tribute to the health workers and others in Canada who had their lives disrupted and threatened by this disease. When the virus returned to start a second outbreak, health workers continued the fight and have now won it. We also need to remember the commitment of Canada’s scientists, who rapidly provided information about the virus and its epidemiology that has benefited public health around the world.”   Toronto was among the first areas affected after the virus moved out of southern China, in late February, and began to spread internationally. WHO advised travellers to avoid all but essential travel to Toronto on 23 April. The advice was lifted a week later. On 14 May, Toronto was removed from the list of areas with recent local transmission, only to return on 26 May after the virus surfaced in a second outbreak.   All of the earliest and most severe SARS outbreaks have been traced to contact with an infected medical doctor from Guangdong Province, China, who spent a single night (21 February) on the 9th floor of the Metropole Hotel in Hong Kong. At least 16 guests and visitors to the same floor became infected. One has been identified as the source case, at the Princes of Wales Hospital, for the Hong Kong outbreak. Others, who carried the virus with them when they returned home, seeded outbreaks in Toronto, Viet Nam, and Singapore.   The mechanisms by which the virus spread from one infected person to so many guests and visitors are still not fully understood. No hotel staff were infected.   Another mystery is why the SARS virus spreads more efficiently in sophisticated hospital settings – another factor that may have contributed to the severity of Toronto’s outbreak. Both epidemiological and anecdotal evidence suggests that certain procedures, such as difficult intubation and use of nebulizers, that are more common in sophisticated hospitals also increase the risk of infection.   When the outbreak began in Toronto and, simultaneously, at the other initial sites, no one was yet aware that a new disease, capable of rapid spread within hospitals, had surfaced in China. Hospital staff, struggling to save lives, were unaware of the need to protect themselves. As a result, the SARS virus spread rapidly within hospitals and then out into the wider community as other patients, hospital visitors, and close contacts of staff became infected.   After WHO issued the first global alert to SARS, on 12 March, all countries experiencing imported cases, with the notable exception of Taiwan, have been able to either prevent any further cases or keep the number of additional cases very small.   With today’s change in the status of Toronto, Taiwan now remains the last area in the world to have experienced recent local transmission of SARS.  "
"2003","http://www.who.int/csr/don/2003_07_01/en/index.html"," Update 92 – Chronology of travel recommendations, areas with local transmission   1 July 2003   If no unexpected events occur, the last two areas in the world – Toronto and Taiwan – to have experienced local transmission of SARS will be declared later this week to have broken the chain of person-to-person transmission. This achievement will mean that the SARS coronavirus is no longer thought to be circulating in the human population.   From the outset, WHO’s objective in combating SARS has been to seal off opportunities for the disease to become established in its new human host. Interruption of human transmission will be a milestone on the way to achieving this goal.   However, scientists cannot at present guarantee that SARS has been vanquished, as questions remain about the origins of the virus and its possible seasonal occurrence. In addition, transmission may be occurring somewhere in the world at such a low level as to defy detection.   In line with the WHO objective, recommendations to postpone travel to designated areas were periodically issued. Evidence that SARS was being exported from areas with local transmission was of particular concern, as this contributed to further international spread and created a heavy burden in terms of isolation and infection control, contact tracing, and quarantine.   The list of areas with recent local transmission was initially developed to support the case definitions of suspect and probable cases, as both definitions depend on a history of close contact with a SARS patient. Application of the case definitions required knowledge of areas where the virus was spreading. Inclusion on the list also provided the basis for recommended exist screening of all departing passengers as a measure for preventing further international spread.   The chronology below provides a record of travel recommendations issued by WHO and of changes in the status of local transmission.   Background   12 March:  WHO issues first global alert to cases of atypical pneumonia rapidly spreading among hospital staff.   15 March:  WHO issues first emergency travel advisory, calling on all travellers to be aware of the main symptoms and signs of SARS. The disease appears to be spreading along the routes of international air travel.   24 March:  Hong Kong officials report 9 cases of atypical pneumonia among members of a tour group that travelled together on two flights, raising the possibility of in-flight transmission. Subsequent investigations revealed that one infected passenger, on a 15 March flight from Hong Kong to Beijing, may have infected 22 fellow passengers and 2 flight attendants.   25 March:  WHO reminds travellers to remain alert, but sees no need for travel restrictions to any destinations. Most new cases are being quickly identified and immediately isolated, thus reducing opportunities for transmission outside confined areas, such as the health care setting.   27 March:  WHO recommends exit screening of air passengers departing from areas where transmission is known to be occurring in local chains. No cases of suspected in-flight transmission are reported following this date.   31 March:  A large cluster of almost simultaneous cases, linked to the Amoy Gardens housing estate in Hong Kong, raises the possibility of an environmental source of infection and provides strong evidence that SARS has moved out of the hospital setting and into the community at large. In addition, several areas link their first imported cases to a history of travel in Guangdong or Hong Kong. These events set the stage for the first travel recommendations.   Travel recommendations (postpone all but essential travel)   2 April:  Issued for Hong Kong and Guangdong Province, China.   23 April:  Issued for Beijing and Shanxi Province, China, and for Toronto, Canada.   30 April:  Lifted for Toronto.   8 May:  Issued for Tianjin and Inner Mongolia, China, and Taipei, Taiwan.   17 May:  Issued for Hebei Province, China.   21 May:  Issued for all of Taiwan.   23 May:  Lifted for Hong Kong and Guangdong Province,   13 June:  Lifted for Heibei, Inner Mongolia, Shanxi, and Tianjin provinces, China.   17 June:  Lifted for Taiwan   24 June Lifted for Beijing – the last area on the list.   Changes in the list of areas with recent local transmission   22 March:  Initial list includes Toronto, parts of mainland China, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Singapore, and Viet Nam.   11 April:  Beijing added.   28 April:  Viet Nam removed – becomes first country to contain its SARS outbreak.   1 May: Mongolia added.   7 May:  Philippines added.   9 May:  Mongolia removed.   14 May:  Toronto removed.   20 May:  Philippines removed.   26 May:  Toronto added for second time.   31 May:  Singapore removed.   13 June:  Guangdong, Hebei, Hubei, Inner Mongolia, Jilin, Jiangsu, Shaanxi, Shanxi, and Tianjin (China) removed.   23 June:  Hong Kong removed.   24 June:  Beijing removed.   1 July:  Only Toronto and Taiwan remain on the list.

"2003","http://www.who.int/csr/don/2003_06_30/en/index.html"," Update 91 – SARS research: the effect of patents and patent applications   30 June   As no new probable cases of SARS have been reported anywhere in the world since 15 June, WHO is moving from an emergency response to a research-based agenda aimed at protecting the world against any future resurgence of SARS.   The world must be considered vulnerable to a return of SARS pending better understanding of the origins of the virus and the circumstances that allowed it to jump from an animal host or environmental source to infect humans. Without such an understanding, predictions of the future evolution of the outbreak – including its end – cannot be made with certainty.   The SARS coronavirus was detected within a month by a “virtual” network of laboratories, working around the clock. The complete sequencing of the virus’ genome followed almost immediately.   These breakthroughs have supported progress in the development of diagnostic tests and greatly facilitated the investigation of unusual outbreaks, such as the Amoy Gardens housing cluster that affected more than 320 persons in late March. They also facilitated initial efforts to link an animal species with the first human cases, which were detected in southern China in mid-November of last year.   Further progress in the scientific understanding of SARS will depend on continued international collaboration. WHO is establishing an additional network to expedite much-needed animal studies.   WHO also intends to monitor the effects of patents and patent applications on the speed with which SARS diagnostic tests, treatments, and vaccines are developed and made available for use, and on the manner in which prices are set for these technologies.   At the moment, it is too early to know all the effects that the patenting of SARS-related discoveries will have. However, the filing of patent applications does not in itself erect any barriers to continued scientific collaboration on SARS.   The “defensive” use of patents can be a legitimate part of a researcher’s efforts to make a discovery, and related discoveries in the future, widely available to other researchers, in the best collaborative tradition of biomedical science.   In the longer term, the manner in which SARS patent rights are pursued could have a profound effect on the willingness of researchers and public health officials to collaborate during future outbreaks of new infections diseases.   WHO will therefore examine whether the terms of reference for such collaborations need to be modified to ensure that the credit for any intellectual property developed is appropriately attributed, that revenues derived from licensing such property are devoted to suitable uses, and that legitimate rewards for innovative efforts do not impose undue burdens on efforts to make tests, therapies, and preventive measures available to all.   As SARS has clearly demonstrated, the appearance of a new disease in a highly mobile, interconnected and interdependent world can have serious repercussions outside the health sector and far beyond the areas worst hit by the outbreak. This sense of shared vulnerability is considered a strong motivation for continued international collaboration.  "
"2003","http://www.who.int/csr/don/2003_06_27/en/index.html"," Update 90 – Case in Japan discarded, criteria for removal from the list of countries with recent local transmission   27 June   Case in Japan The Japanese Ministry of Health has today informed WHO that the probable SARS case, reported on Wednesday, has now been discarded. Further laboratory testing has confirmed a diagnosis of influenza B as the cause of the patient's symptoms.   The case involved a 33-year-old man from Taiwan, who arrived in Tokyo on 21 June and developed symptoms, including a high fever, two days later.   Criteria for removal from the WHO list Questions have recently been raised about the criteria for removal of an area from the WHO list of areas with recent local transmission of SARS. An area is removed when twenty days - or twice the incubation period - have passed since the last reported probable case was placed in effective isolation, left the area, or died. If no new cases are detected during this period, the chain of transmission is considered broken.   Isolation of a probable SARS case removes the person from the community and thus reduces opportunities for the virus to spread to others. It does not, however, entirely eliminate the risk of further transmission. A twenty-day period with no new infections is considered essential to demonstrate that further transmission has not occurred. Effective isolation means that patients with SARS are managed according to strict procedures of infection control at the health care facility, including strict adherence to the use of personal protective equipment by staff.   Removal from the list after 20 days applies only to the effective isolation of the last symptomatic case, not to contacts of a SARS case placed in home isolation as a precautionary measure. Experience to date indicates that transmission of SARS occurs when a person is ill. Asymptomatic contacts do not appear to pose an infectious risk to others.   To declare that a chain of transmission has been broken 20 days after the isolation of a person who has no symptoms and therefore poses no risk of spreading the disease would give a false sense of security. It reduces the period of medical follow-up and isolation considered essential to determine that no further transmission is likely to occur.   For this reason, WHO is maintaining its strict criteria - 20 days after a patient, following the onset of symptoms, was either placed in isolation, left the area, or died - for determining when a country can be safely removed from the list of areas with recent local transmission. As recent experiences have demonstrated, SARS is an especially resilient and unforgiving disease, ready to take advantage of any lapse in vigilance or control procedures.   At present, only Toronto and Taiwan remain on the list. In Toronto, the most recently detected probable case began showing symptoms on 12 June and was immediately placed in isolation. The last reported probable case in Taiwan was detected and isolated on 15 June. The list of areas with recent local transmission was initially developed to assist in application of the WHO definitions of suspect and probable cases of SARS. Both case definitions require a history of close contact with a suspect or probable case. A list of countries where local transmission is occurring helps physicians determine whether contact with a case was possible and thus assists in reaching a diagnosis.  "
"2003","http://www.who.int/csr/don/2003_06_26/en/index.html"," Update 89 – What happens if SARS returns?   26 June   Earlier this week, WHO removed Hong Kong and Beijing – the world’s two most severely affected cities – from its list of areas with recent local transmission of SARS. Only Toronto and Taiwan continue to experience chains of local transmission, and these outbreaks are likewise being brought close to containment.   After almost four months, the global public health emergency caused by the sudden appearance and rapid spread of SARS is coming to an end.   The SARS virus, a new and unique member of the coronavirus family, first emerged in mid-November in southern China. One of the key questions now is whether SARS – pushed out of its new human host as chains of transmission are broken – will return.   The question arises because of the behaviour of other comparatively new and poorly understood viruses, including those that cause the Ebola and Marburg haemorrhagic fevers. These viruses periodically surface to cause outbreaks, usually limited to a defined geographical area, and then fade away to hide in some animal or environmental reservoir until conditions again become ripe for spread to humans.   The question of whether SARS will likewise resurface must remain open pending better understanding of the circumstances that allowed the new disease to emerge. The SARS virus is thought to have jumped to humans from some animal or environmental source.   Many new viruses that jump from animals to humans, including the Nipah, Hendra, and hanta viruses, do not spread efficiently from one person to another and thus do not cause large and sustained outbreaks with a potential for rapid international spread. The SARS virus, however, spreads readily from person to person. Factors in the hospital environment have worked to amplify this efficient transmission considerably. In addition, though SARS has a high case fatality (around 15%), it allows enough of its victims to survive long enough to spread the disease to others – an effective survival strategy for a new virus.   The WHO scientific coordinator for SARS, Dr Klaus Stöhr, is presently in China working together with scientists there to develop and prioritize a SARS research agenda. Research on the origins of the SARS virus is expected to top the agenda.   In the meantime, WHO has good reason to believe that, should SARS resurface later this year, the global impact will be milder than experienced during the initial global emergency. Five reasons support this view.   First, the world’s public health systems have demonstrated their capacity to move quickly into a phase of high alert. The prompt detection and isolation of imported cases in African and India are good examples of both the level of vigilance and its effectiveness in preventing further spread. Some of the former SARS hotspots, including Hong Kong and Singapore, plan to maintain a high level of vigilance, supported by measures for screening and detection, until at least the end of the year.   Second, the world knows what to do. Control measures, though centuries old, have demonstrated their capacity to completely halt outbreaks, as most recently seen in Singapore, Hong Kong, and Beijing.   Third, the intensive research effort currently under way can be expected to improve scientific understanding of SARS and yield better control tools, most notably a rapid and reliable point-of-care diagnostic test.   Fourth, resolutions adopted during the May World Health Assembly have strengthened WHO’s capacity to respond to outbreaks in important ways. In effect, these resolutions allow WHO to move from a passive reliance on official government notifications to a proactive role in warning the world as soon as evidence indicates that an outbreak poses a threat to international public health.   Finally and perhaps most importantly, SARS has underscored the importance of immediately and fully disclosing cases of any disease with the potential for international spread. In the present climate of opinion, influenced by the lessons learned from SARS, it appears unlikely that any country would choose to conceal cases, should SARS resurface. In addition, SARS is simply too big a disease to hide for long.   For these reasons, WHO is optimistic that, should SARS return, it will not do so with a vengeance.  "
"2003","http://www.who.int/csr/don/2003_06_25/en/index.html"," Update 88 – New cases reported in China and Japan   25 June   WHO has today received reports of new probable cases of SARS in China and Japan.   China The Chinese Ministry of Health has today reported a new probable case of SARS involving a 77-year-old woman who fell ill in Guangdong Province. The case had previously been classified as a suspect case and, according to WHO recommendations, was placed in isolation on 3 June.   This is the first new case reported in Guangdong since 17 May. The last new case reported anywhere in mainland China was on 11 June.   WHO is stressing that this is a reclassification of a suspect case as a probable case and, as such, should not be taken as an indication that local transmission has occurred. WHO is awaiting further details about the case and its relationship to documented chains of transmission that may point to the source of infection and the timing of exposure.   The most likely explanation is that the case, with its onset in early June, will be linked to a chain of transmission that was subsequently broken.   Meticulous records kept by Hong Kong authorities have revealed that the woman was hospitalized in Hong Kong and treated for other illnesses from 20 to 21 May. As her room was on the same ward as a SARS patient, she was placed under health surveillance until 1 June. No SARS symptoms developed during this period, which represents the maximum incubation period.   However, a possible link with the Hong Kong hospital cannot be entirely ruled out at this time. As became apparent during last week’s global conference on SARS, the disease does not always follow a clinically predictable course in elderly patients, particularly when they have been treated for co-morbidity with other diseases.   Guangdong, which saw the first cases of SARS in mid-November of last year, was removed from the list of areas with recent local transmission on 13 June. This retrospective reporting of a case newly classified as a “probable” case does not constitute a reason for any change in the status of Guangdong.   Japan The Japanese Ministry of Health has today reported a probable case of SARS involving a 33-year-old man who arrived in Tokyo, for sightseeing, on 21 June and developed symptoms two days later. He was immediately hospitalized and managed according to WHO recommendations.   Initial diagnostic tests have ruled out other common causes of severe respiratory disease. Further testing is under way and epidemiological investigations have been initiated. As the patient is a resident of Taiwan, health officials there are contributing to the investigation.   Comment on new cases When an outbreak wanes while vigilance is still high, a few additional cases are almost always detected. Their prompt reporting provides further assurance that surveillance systems are alert. However, WHO anticipates that many reported cases during this phase of the outbreak will turn out, on further investigation, to be “background noise” – that is, cases of community-acquired pneumonia caused by agents other than the SARS virus.   In areas that have experienced large outbreaks and therefore accumulated considerable skill in the clinical and laboratory diagnosis of cases, reports of newly detected probable cases are less likely to be discarded upon further investigation.

Beijing was the last area in the world to which this advice still applied.   The recommendation to consider postponing all but essential travel to Beijing was issued on 23 April in order to minimize the international spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). WHO is changing this recommendation as the situation in the Chinese capital has now improved significantly. The last new case in Beijing was isolated on May 29, since when a number of suspect cases have been considered but ruled out as SARS. No cases have recently been exported from Beijing and all recent cases have been traced to known chains of transmission.   “We are changing the travel advice for Beijing effective Tuesday, June 24,” said Dr Gro Harlem Brundtland, Director-General of the WHO. “Beijing is the last area to which WHO recommended that people should postpone all but essential travel. This is very good news and shows the great progress the world has made against SARS.    Beijing, with a cumulative total of 2521 probable cases and 191 deaths, has had the largest outbreak of SARS anywhere in the world, followed by Hong Kong, with 1755 cumulative cases and 296 deaths, and Guangdong Province, China, with 1511 cumulative cases and 57 deaths.   For reasons that are not yet fully understood, areas of mainland China have experienced a lower case fatality ratio than seen in most other outbreaks.   China began daily reporting of SARS cases in early April, when Beijing reported 29 cases and 4 deaths. At the peak of the outbreak, towards the end of April, Beijing was reporting more than 100 new cases each day. Containment of an outbreak of such dimensions is a tribute to the effectiveness of centuries-old control measures, including isolation, contact tracing, and quarantine, supported by government commitment at the highest levels.   Recommendations to postpone travel have been issued following consideration of several factors, including the magnitude of probable SARS cases, the pattern of recent local transmission, and the last dates of export of cases.   On 27 March, WHO recommended that all areas with recent local transmission should screen all international departing passengers to ensure that those who are showing symptoms of SARS or have had recent contact with a SARS patient do not travel. Since then, a number of recommendations have been made that people should postpone all but essential travel to areas with large outbreaks of SARS which posed a potential threat to travellers.   More than 20 days have now passed since the last new case was isolated in Beijing. Therefore, Beijing has also been removed from the list of areas with recent local transmission.  "

"2003","http://www.who.int/csr/don/2003_06_23/en/index.html"," Update 86 - Hong Kong removed from list of areas with local transmission   23 June   WHO has today removed Hong Kong from its list of areas with recent local transmission of SARS. Twenty days, which is twice the maximum incubation period, have passed since the last case was isolated on 2 June.   When 20 days have passed since removal of the last case from the community at large, the chain of human-to-human transmission is considered broken, thus eliminating the risk of infection for both local residents and travellers.   “This is a very significant achievement,” said Dr David Heymann, Executive Director of Communicable Diseases at WHO. “Hong Kong, with its dense population and fluid border with China, had one of the hardest outbreaks to control. This success means that the whole world can now feel safer from the SARS threat.”   SARS was first carried out of southern China into Hong Kong, and then on to Hanoi, Toronto, and Singapore in late February. Some 16 visitors and guests to the ninth floor of a Hong Kong hotel became infected through contact, in ways that remain mysterious, with a symptomatic medical doctor from Guangdong Province, who stayed in the hotel’s room 911. The index case for Hong Kong’s first outbreak, in the Prince of Wales Hospital, visited an acquaintance staying on the same floor during the critical days in February. Additional clusters were also subsequently linked to the hotel.   SARS had not yet been identified as a dangerous new disease when the outbreak hit Hong Kong’s hospitals. Doctors and nurses, unaware of the need to isolate patients and protect themselves, became the first victims as they struggled to save lives. In a particularly unfortunate incident, the index patient at Prince of Wales, admitted on 4 March, was treated four times daily with a jet nebulizer, which probably aerosolized the virus and greatly increased opportunities for spread.   In late March, Hong Kong suffered a major setback when a large cluster, eventually numbering more than 300, of almost simultaneous new cases was traced to a single building in the Amoy Gardens housing state. That event, which raised the possibility of an environmental source of infection or even airborne spread of the virus, was investigated by teams of local specialists. The outbreak was attributed to an “unlucky” convergence of environmental conditions that allowed the contamination of vertically-linked apartments. This conclusion, subsequently confirmed by additional studies, calmed fears that the SARS virus might be airborne.   From the day when the first cluster of cases was recognized, Hong Kong officials have provided open, honest, and abundant information about SARS to both the public and the media. Hong Kong also benefited from the contribution of its outstanding scientists, epidemiologists, and clinicians, who were at the forefront of efforts to track down source cases in the various clusters, identify the causative agent, develop diagnostic tests, and work out treatment protocols.   Faced with the largest outbreak outside mainland China, Hong Kong also pioneered many of the control measures used to successfully contain smaller outbreaks elsewhere. It is gratifying that these measures have now brought Hong Kong to the point of victory over the virus, although continued vigilance remains vital.   On 2 April, WHO advised the public to consider postponing all but essential travel to Hong Kong. That recommendation was removed more than 7 weeks later, on 23 May.  "
"2003","http://www.who.int/csr/don/2003_06_20/en/index.html"," Update 85 - WHO case definition for diagnostic purposes, Hong Kong close to being removed from list of areas with local transmission   20 June  WHO case definition for diagnostic purposes   An article published in this week's British Medical Journal has questioned whether the WHO case definitions for suspected and probable SARS are adequate to pick up infected cases at the earliest stage when patients are said to be most infectious.   British Medical Journal table of contents    The WHO case definition takes a  wide net  approach, and is intended to assist in the identification and prompt isolation of any person who might have been exposed to the SARS virus. WHO continues to recommend that suspect cases be immediately isolated and remain so until either a probable diagnosis is made or another agent is determined to be the cause.   While this definition has worked well to contain the outbreak in this initial emergency response, WHO is fully aware that a more precise definition is needed for longer-term surveillance.   Pending the development of a reliable point-of-care diagnostic test, case definitions, based on an evaluation of symptoms and history of possible contact with a SARS patient, remain the only way to find possibly infected persons and reduce opportunities for further spread. WHO therefore welcomes the BMJ study, which suggests that additional symptoms might contribute to a more sensitive definition. However, this is a single study based on patients presenting at a single hospital. Moreover, by inclusion of symptoms such as diarrhoea, this definition risks picking up even more false-positive cases.   During the Kuala Lumpur global conference on SARS, WHO established a working group specifically charged to develop better case definitions. The group will draw on data from all the main outbreak sites.    WHO regards an improved diagnostic test as a top priority,  said David Heymann, the WHO Executive Director for Communicable Diseases.  The next influenza season will result in a large number of patients with symptoms easily confused with SARS. In addition to a good diagnostic test, a more precise and sensitive case definition is absolutely essential to keep health services from being overwhelmed. We will be producing this as an international collaborative effort, based on the best available evidence.    Dr Heymann estimates that SARS surveillance will need to continue for at least a year. WHO recommendations for surveillance and reporting are also being revised for this second phase, which moves from an emergency response to sustainable vigilance.  Hong Kong close to being removed from list   On Sunday 22 June, 20 days will have passed since the last probable case of SARS in Hong Kong was placed in isolation on 2 June. If no new cases are detected over the weekend, Hong Kong will be removed from the list of areas with recent local transmission on Monday.   Both WHO and health authorities in Hong Kong are taking a cautious approach to what would be a very significant achievement in the history of SARS control. WHO was given details today about a suspect SARS case who has been in isolation since 9 June. The results of 3 PCR tests have been negative. Serology tests, conducted 20 days after the onset of symptoms, have also been negative.   Today's report on this case confers another layer of assurance that surveillance remains intense and that new cases continue to be quickly detected and isolated. As Hong Kong scientists and laboratories rank among the best in the world, WHO has full confidence that the case in question is not SARS.   Removal from the list means that the chain of person-to-person transmission has been broken, thus eliminating the risk of infection for both local residents and travellers.   On 2 April, WHO advised the public to consider postponing all but essential travel to Hong Kong. That recommendation was removed more than 7 weeks later, on 23 May.   Travel recommendations are presently in place only for Beijing, China.  "
"2003","http://www.who.int/csr/don/2003_06_19/en/index.html"," Update 84 – Can SARS be eradicated or eliminated?   19 June   The first global conference on SARS, held on Tuesday and Wednesday in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, was convened by WHO to provide technical guidance for the ongoing and long-term response to SARS.   As the number of new cases continues to dwindle, one of the most important questions for the future is whether SARS can be eliminated or eradicated from its new human host. Experience with many other infectious diseases, including smallpox and poliomyelitis, has demonstrated that complete eradication of an infectious disease is possible only when three precise requirements can be met.   First, an effective intervention capable of interrupting transmission – ideally, a vaccine – must be available. Second, easy-to-use diagnostic tools are needed, with sufficient sensitivity and specificity to detect levels of infection that can lead to transmission of the disease. Finally, infection of humans must be essential to the life-cycle of the causative agent – if the chain of human-to-human transmission is broken, the agent cannot survive. Existence of an animal reservoir greatly complicates eradication, but does not preclude it, provided interventions exist to break the chain of transmission in the animal species as well.   To achieve eradication at the global level, the control intervention must be safe, simple, and affordable. Current control measures for SARS, including case detection and isolation, tracing and follow-up of contacts, and quarantine, are effective but extremely time-intensive, costly, and socially disruptive. Few if any countries can sustain such efforts over time.   As noted during yesterday’s conference sessions, an adequate point-of-care diagnostic test is still not available for SARS and remains a top priority. Such a test would likewise need to be sufficiently simple and affordable to be used in countries having a range of different health systems and resources for health care.   Researchers at the conference also confirmed that far too little is understood about the origins of the SARS virus and the possible role – if any – that animals play in the transmission cycle. Some studies have suggested that the earliest cases of SARS, in Guangdong Province, China, may have had contact, during slaughter or due to proximity to so-called “wet” markets, with certain wild animal species consumed as delicacies in southern China. In addition, a SARS-like virus has been detected in a few of these wild animal species. Additional studies are urgently needed before any firm conclusions can be reached. Answers to these questions will also greatly assist predictions of the future evolution of SARS.   For the time being, WHO continues to stress the need to break the chain of human-to-human transmission through use of currently available control tools. In many of the most severely affected areas, these measures have already demonstrated their ability to eliminate SARS in a defined geographical area.   However, the long-term response to SARS, which includes the prevention of importation or re-importation of cases into SARS-free areas, will clearly require different strategies for surveillance and response, as current measures cannot be sustained over time.   Moreover, scientists cannot, on the basis of the very limited data available, rule out the possibility that SARS will resurface when environmental conditions or seasons again favour transmission among humans. Should this occur, countries will need to be ready with alert surveillance systems and good preparedness strategies.  "

"2003","http://www.who.int/csr/don/2003_06_18/en/index.html"," Update 83 – One hundred days into the outbreak   June 18   Tomorrow will mark the 100th day since WHO first alerted the world, on 12 March, to the SARS threat. From the 55 cases recognized on that day, alarmingly concentrated in hospitals in Hong Kong, Hanoi, and Singapore, the outbreak exploded within a month to cause some 3000 cases and more than 100 deaths in 20 countries on all continents.   By that time, too, the public face of SARS had come to be symbolized by a mask – an appropriate image for a disease still shrouded in mystery. Although the causative agent was conclusively identified on 17 April, the disease had no vaccine, no effective treatment, an overall case fatality of 15%, and many unexplained features. As the coming weeks would reveal, SARS was also full of surprises.   SARS was carried out of southern China, where the first cases are now known to have occurred in late November 2002, by an infected medical doctor who spent a single night on the 9th floor of a Hong Kong hotel in late February. He infected at least 16 other persons staying on or visiting the same floor. From this single event, which is still not fully understood in terms of the dynamics of transmission, SARS spread internationally.   The number of cases passed 4000 on 23 April and then rapidly soared to 5000 on 28 April, 6000 on 2 May, and 7000 on 8 May, when cases were reported from 30 countries. During the peak of the global outbreak, near the start of May, more than 200 new cases were being reported each day. Detection of new infections subsequently slowed, passing 8000 on 22 May.   During June, the number of new cases has gradually dwindled to the present daily handful. WHO is confident that all countries that have experienced outbreaks are disclosing cases fully and promptly – SARS is too big a disease to hide for long. The global outbreak, at least in this initial phase, is clearly coming under control.   The reduced number of cases is not a “natural phenomenon” that can be attributed to a change in the virulence or infectivity of the SARS virus, as often happens with new diseases that quickly “burn out”. Instead, the dramatic reduction in the number of SARS cases is the result of monumental efforts on the part of governments and health care staff, supported by a well-informed and cooperative public.   The achievement is all the more impressive when viewed against the nature of SARS as an especially difficult and dangerous new disease.   SARS is the first severe and readily transmissible new disease to strike a globalized society. As such, its history to date illustrates the favourable conditions, both for the devastating spread of a new disease and solidarity in its containment, that have come to characterize a closely interconnected, interdependent, and highly mobile world. On the negative side, the volume of international air travel allowed SARS to spread around the world with unprecedented speed. Also on the negative side, the close interdependence of economies and markets amplified the economic impact of SARS considerably, while instantaneous electronic communications elevated public concern – often to the point of panic – and further added to the social and economic disruption caused by SARS.   Just as Ebola came to symbolize the fear inspired by a new disease, SARS has vividly depicted a truism of the infectious disease situation in a globalized world: an outbreak anywhere places every country at risk. The containment of SARS – or any other epidemic-prone disease – requires unprecedented solidarity and makes such an effort a matter of self-interest for every nation.   The success to date clearly demonstrates that a spirit of international solidarity has been a driving force in the rapid containment of SARS.   On the positive side, the power of electronic communications allowed the establishment of “virtual” networks of researchers, epidemiologists, and clinicians, who set aside competition and collaborated around the clock to identify the SARS causative agent, sequence its genome, define clinical features, and investigate modes of transmission in record time.   The world’s electronic interconnectedness also contributed to the effectiveness of the first global alerts to SARS. The initial 12 March alert, followed three days later by a stronger and more specific warning, provided a clear line of demarcation in the early history of SARS. Areas with cases prior to the alert experienced the most devastating outbreaks. These occurred in Hong Kong, Hanoi, Singapore, Toronto, and China. Prior to 12 March, in all these cases, hospital staff, unaware that a new disease had surfaced and was spreading in health care settings, took no precautions to protect themselves as they fought to save the lives of patients. SARS spread rapidly in these hospitals, and then spilled over into the wider community, resulting in the exportation of cases elsewhere.   With the notable exception of Taiwan, all other areas experiencing imported cases after the alerts were able to prevent further transmission altogether or hold the number of additional cases to a very small number. Most observers attribute this success to the high level of awareness and preparedness that followed the alerts, greatly aided by responsible reporting in the media.   Key weapon: the thermometer One of the most important lessons learned to date is the decisive power of high-level political commitment to contain an outbreak even when sophisticated control tools are lacking. SARS has been brought close to defeat by the diligent and unrelenting application – on a monumental scale – of centuries-old control measures: isolation, contact tracing and follow-up, quarantine, and travel restrictions. Other successful measures include the designation of SARS-dedicated hospitals to minimize the risk of spread to other hospitals, mass media campaigns to educate the public and encourage prompt reporting of symptoms, and the establishment of fever clinics to relieve pressure on emergency rooms, which have also been the setting for many new infections. Screening at airports and other border points and, through fever checks, throughout selected population groups has also been effective.   All of these measures contributed to the prompt detection and isolation of new sources of infection – a key step on the way to breaking the chain of transmission. Given the importance of supportive public attitudes and actions, the single most important control “tool” in bringing SARS under control may very well be the thermometer.   Viet Nam broke the chain of transmission on 28 April, as did the Philippines on 20 May, and Singapore on 31 May. Recommendations to postpone all but essential travel have been removed for all areas except Beijing, China.   In reaching these landmarks in the containment of SARS, the most severely affected countries and areas have identified and rapidly corrected long-standing weaknesses in their health systems in ways that will mean permanent improvements for the management of all diseases. In addition, systems of data collection and reporting, and new patterns of openly and frankly communicating information to the public will hold the world in good stead when the next new disease emerges and the next influenza pandemic breaks out.   Continued surveillance and vigilance needed for a year SARS has repeatedly demonstrated its resilience, most recently with the resurgence of cases in Toronto. As underscored by researchers at this week’s meeting in Kuala Lumpur , SARS has features that can thwart even the best preparedness plans and slip past even the highest levels of awareness and suspicion. Under the right conditions, which remain poorly understood, single highly infectious persons have been known to set off trains of transmission that have led, in the worst cases, to almost 100 additional infections. In Singapore, five patients accounted for 103 of the total 206 cases in the outbreak.   Another significant problem occurs when SARS symptoms are masked by other diseases. Many surprising clusters of cases have been fanned by such patients, as they do not arouse suspicion, are not isolated or managed according to strict procedures of infection control, have no restrictions on visitors, and are frequently transferred to other hospitals for further treatment or tests.   Although SARS is clearly coming under control, the need for continued vigilance is now greater than ever. The world still has a chance to interrupt the chain of person-to-person transmission everywhere. However, because of the many unanswered scientific questions, particularly concerning the origins of the virus and the contribution of environmental contamination to overall transmission, WHO sees a need for at least a full year of surveillance to determine whether the disease has established endemicity and to ensure that no cases have spread, undetected, to countries with poor surveillance and reporting systems. If the disease has not become endemic, the next big hurdles will concern the questions of a possible animal reservoir and possible seasonal recurrence. Scientists cannot rule out the possibility that the SARS virus hides somewhere in nature, as the Ebola virus does, only to return when conditions are once again ripe for the efficient spread of infection to its new human host.   Finally, as underscored in today’s conference sessions, the development of a reliable point-of-care diagnostic test must be given high priority. Pending the availability of such a test, and for a while yet to come, every case of atypical pneumonia has the potential to arouse suspicion and spark a panic. Any hospital-based cluster of febrile patients with respiratory symptoms will need extensive investigation. And any person with a fever or cough could be barred from international travel.   As long as a single case of SARS exists or is suspected anywhere in the world, and as long as fundamental questions about the origins of the virus remain unanswered, all countries need to remain on guard.

"2003","http://www.who.int/csr/don/2003_06_17/en/index.html"," Update 82 – Change in travel recommendations for Taiwan   17 June   WHO has today removed Taiwan, Province of China  from its list of areas to which travellers are advised to avoid all but essential travel. The move follows vast improvements in case detection, infection control, and the tracing and follow-up of contacts that led to a steep drop in the daily number of new cases.   “The SARS crisis in Taiwan has been taken very seriously at all levels,” said Dr Cathy Roth, a WHO virologist who was in Taiwan in May to assess the need for a strengthened response. “SARS stimulated vast and very rapid improvements in the health infrastructure, especially in the areas of hospital infection control procedures, systems for data collection and reporting, mobilization of the public, and coordination of all agencies contributing to the outbreak response. We hope these improvements are permanent.”   WHO recommends that all areas which have experienced local transmission of SARS maintain a high level of vigilance, as a single imported case or lapse in infection control can reignite an outbreak.   The decision to lift a travel advisory is based on consideration of several criteria, including the number of active cases, the number of new cases being reported daily, patterns of local transmission, and evidence that cases are no longer being exported elsewhere. The adequacy of surveillance measures, including screening for new cases and tracing and follow-up of contacts, is also considered. Together, these factors help determine whether travellers, as well as local residents, are at risk of acquiring infection outside confined settings, such as the health care environment.   Taiwan, which has experienced the third largest outbreak on record, initially had only a few imported cases, all clearly linked together in chains of person-to-person transmission. Following lapses in infection control practices in a hospital, the outbreak escalated dramatically, with as many as 70 new cases per day being reported in mid-May. The large number of new cases reported daily was also partly due to a large backlog of cases pending investigation.   WHO continues to recommend that persons planning to travel to Beijing, China consider postponing all but essential travel. No other travel-related recommendations are in place.  "

"2003","http://www.who.int/csr/don/2003_06_16/en/index.html"," Update 81 – WHO scientific meeting on SARS opens tomorrow   16 June   The first global conference on SARS will open tomorrow in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. The two-day event, which has been convened by WHO, will be attended by more than 1000 scientists and clinicians, including specialists who have been at the front line of SARS investigation and response since the outbreak began.   In organizing the conference, WHO aims to gather expert views about the effectiveness of the response to date and the likely evolution of SARS in both the near future and longer term. The identification of priority areas for further investigation is another objective.   The meeting comes at a time when the intense around-the-clock emergency actions needed to contain the initial outbreaks have slowed, allowing time to assess the evidence that has accumulated and identify gaps in knowledge.   From the outset, the response to SARS has been characterized by unprecedented high-level scientific collaboration, which led to the identification of the causative agent, a new coronavirus, within a month. However, many fundamental scientific questions remain, a reliable point-of-care diagnostic test is not yet available, and no effective cure has been identified. In the absence of better knowledge and control tools, the response to SARS has been forced to rely on centuries-old measures: isolation, quarantine, and travel restrictions.   On the first day of the meeting, invited speakers will provide an overview of what is currently known about the clinical behaviour of SARS, its causative agent, modes of transmission, the effectiveness of control measures, and possible origins in an animal species. Debate is expected to centre on some of the disease’s many mysteries, including reasons for the rapid deterioration of some patients and spontaneous recovery of others, the comparatively mild form of illness seen in children, and the contribution of certain source cases to especially rapid spread of infection. Other unresolved issues include the possibility of an animal reservoir, and the significance of environmental sources of infection, as experienced during the outbreaks at the Metropole Hotel and in the Amoy Gardens housing estate.   Presentations on blood safety and on possible animal sources of infection are indicative of the wide range of concerns raised by a new, severe, and poorly understood disease.   The second day is organized around working sessions that are expected to answer questions important in the ongoing response to SARS and in gauging preparedness for other epidemic-prone diseases. Questions include the effectiveness of current control measures and the adequacy of the public health infrastructure for outbreak alert and response.   Working sessions will also consider technical constraints that may make it impossible to eliminate SARS.   By gathering the views of the world’s leading experts on these and other issues, WHO hopes to establish the scientific basis for recommending more precise control measures and setting out plans for the long-term SARS response that have the best chance of success.

"2003","http://www.who.int/csr/don/2003_06_13/en/index.html"," Update 80 - Change in travel recommendations for parts of China, situation in Toronto   13 June 2003   Change in travel recommendations Effective today, the World Health Organization (WHO) is removing its recommendation that people should postpone all but essential travel to Hebei, Inner Mongolia, Shanxi and Tianjin regions in China.   Recommendations to consider postponing all but essential travel to these regions of China were issued on 23 April and 8 May in order to minimize the international spread of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). WHO is changing this recommendation as the situation in these areas has now improved significantly. Information about the decline of the outbreaks in Hebei, Inner Mongolia, Shanxi and Tianjin has been carefully reviewed by WHO and suggests that SARS is no longer a potential threat to international travellers to these regions.   Recommendations to postpone travel are issued following consideration of several factors, including the magnitude of current SARS cases, the pattern of recent local transmission, and the last dates of export of cases.   In addition, WHO is removing Guangdong, Hebei, Hubei, Inner Mongolia, Jilin, Jiangsu, Shaanxi, Shanxi and Tianjin from the list of areas with recent local transmission. This follows confirmation that there have been no new cases isolated in any of these areas for more than twice the maximum incubation period, in other words more than 20 days.   On 27 March, WHO recommended that areas with recent local transmission should screen all international departing passengers to ensure that those who are sick with SARS or are contacts of SARS cases do not travel. This recommendation is still valid for Beijing, Hong Kong and Taiwan in China, and Toronto, Canada. For a summary of travel recommendations, see the table below.   During a recent trip to Beijing, Dr David Heymann, WHO’s Executive Director for Communicable Diseases, commented on the measures now in place in China to contain the spread of SARS.  We’ve seen that there has been a massive effort to mobilize the population both in urban and rural areas across the country, encouraging people to monitor themselves for fever and to ensure that SARS cases are quickly identified, isolated and treated.     China has made huge strides in its effort to contain the outbreak of SARS,  said Dr Heymann.  The key thing now is to maintain vigilance and build up China's disease surveillance system. Public health authorities in China and around the world must continue to watch out for new cases of SARS to ensure that it does not emerge again elsewhere.    Situation in Toronto The category of pattern of SARS transmission for the city of Toronto has been changed from “B” to “C”. This is because a probable case with laboratory confirmation of SARS coronavirus exported from Toronto had not been previously identified as a contact and put into voluntary home isolation. “Pattern B” transmission is defined as an area having more than one generation of local probable SARS cases, but only among persons who have been previously identified and followed-up as known contacts of probable SARS cases. “Pattern C” transmission is defined as an area having local probable cases occurring among persons who have not been previously identified as known contacts of probable SARS cases.

"2003","http://www.who.int/csr/don/2003_06_12/en/index.html"," Update 79 – Situation in China   12 June 2003   China’s Executive Vice Minister of Health, Mr Gao Qiang, and Dr David Heymann, WHO’s Executive Director for Communicable Diseases, briefed the press this morning on the situation of SARS control in China. Also in attendance were Dr Qi Ziaoqiu, Director-General of the Department of Disease Control in the Chinese Ministry of Health, and Dr Henk Bekedam, WHO Representative to China.   The briefing marked the first joint news conference between high-ranking Chinese and WHO officials since the SARS outbreak began.   The briefing followed a day of intensive meetings during which WHO officials reviewed data and statistics from selected provinces, voiced their concerns, and received frank and detailed answers.   Dr Heymann praised the openness with which the WHO team was welcomed by the Ministry of Health, and described the measures now in place to control and prevent SARS as “excellent”. He cited the high level of commitment and determination at all levels of the health system as largely responsible for the dramatic recent decline in the number of cases seen throughout mainland China.   One purpose of the visit was to determine how China had succeeded in bringing down the number of cases so rapidly, and to encourage officials to share their experiences with the rest of the world.   Indications of the effectiveness of control measures, cited by Dr Heymann, include the very short time now occurring between the onset of symptoms and the detection and isolation of cases, and the speed and efficiency of contact tracing. Such measures are important as they limit the amount of time that an infected person is capable of spreading the virus to others and thus bring control efforts closer to the stage when the chain of person-to-person transmission can be broken.   Other effective measures include systems for both passive and active surveillance, such as fever checks at train and bus stations and airports, a nationwide mass media campaign to inform and educate the public, and a very large number of fever clinics to assess those who suspect they may have symptoms.   “We’ve seen that there has been a massive effort to mobilize the population both in urban and rural areas across the country, encouraging people to monitor themselves for fever and to ensure that SARS cases are quickly identified, isolated and treated.”   Specific concerns expressed by the WHO team include the lack of a sustainable surveillance system that can be relied on to detect the first hints of a resurgence of cases, some delays in meeting WHO requests for further information, and wide variations in application of the national case definitions, which can lead to under-reporting of cases. Some problems related to prompt sharing and analysis of data are considered to arise from institutional and administrative problems, particularly concerning the information flow from provinces to the central level.   Another major concern is the large number of cases that have no known source of exposure, thus making it extremely difficult to trace patterns of transmission. In Beijing, the number of cases with no known contact with a SARS patient has recently increased from 50% to more than 70%.   In the interest of protecting against a further resurgence of cases, WHO officials singled out strengthening of surveillance capacity as the top priority. Experience to date has shown that a single case, especially if highly infectious, can rapidly ignite an explosive outbreak.   “With SARS seemingly on the decline for now, there is a great need to strengthen the SARS control and surveillance system in China,” said Dr Bekedam. “The system now in place grew out of an emergency response and has to be strengthened for the long run.” He expressed doubt that the present system would be strong enough “to hold back the tide” when confronted with a resurgence of the disease.   In his assessment of the long-term SARS situation in China, Dr Heymann also stressed the need for systematic studies of the origins of SARS. “We still don’t know exactly where SARS came from, or how it was transferred to the human population. We don’t know if this disease is seasonal and will decrease this year but come back next year.”   Until proper research into the origins of SARS has been conducted, it will be impossible to predict when the conditions that first allowed the virus to jump to humans from a suspected animal reservoir might be repeated in the near or distant future.   WHO initial assessments of the SARS situation in China, issued in late April following a visit to Guangdong Province, expressed serious concern over the lack of urgency in reporting cases of SARS in China, and criticized the government for not immediately treating the outbreak as a public health emergency requiring extraordinary measures for its control.   Dr Heymann and other members of the WHO team are now satisfied that these measures are in place, at least for the immediate response to SARS. Recent visits to selected provinces, jointly conducted by the Chinese Ministry of Health and WHO, found a high level of public awareness of SARS, its symptoms and mode of transmission, and the need for twice-daily fever checks.   China is regarded as the epicentre of the SARS outbreak. The country was home to the first cases, detected in mid-November of last year, and presently accounts for almost two thirds of all reported cases worldwide. The WHO visit was arranged to secure reassurance that control measures in this vast country are adequate to continue the downward trends in cases and, equally important, to ensure that a sustainable system is in place to detect and contain a resurgence of cases. WHO is also anxious to ensure that the considerable knowledge and experience acquired in managing the largest SARS outbreak on record is shared for the benefit of all countries.   The SARS outbreak has revealed substantial weaknesses in the disease surveillance system in China. When investment in health infrastructure is neglected, conditions are ripe for the unchecked spread of any epidemic-prone disease, often at tremendous cost to a nation’s economy. In the view of WHO, the surveillance system in China needs to be made more flexible and capable of a much more rapid and consistent response to any new infectious disease threat.   During the visit, Chinese officials expressed deep concern about the country’s capacity to deal with the next influenza season against a background of possible SARS cases. The presence of influenza could greatly complicate the detection and accurate diagnosis of SARS cases, while also increasing the caseload of suspect cases considerably.   The containment of SARS remains the overriding objective of WHO. If SARS is not contained, the world will face a situation in which every case of atypical pneumonia, and every hospital-based cluster of febrile patients with respiratory systems will have the potential to rouse suspicions of SARS and spark widespread panic.   In an earlier report, a WHO assessment team reached the following conclusion: “If SARS is not brought under control in China, there will be no chance of controlling the global threat of SARS. Achieving control of SARS is a major challenge especially in a country as large and diverse as China. Effective disease control and reporting are the cornerstone of any strategy to do this.”  "
"2003","http://www.who.int/csr/don/2003_06_11a/en/index.html"," Update 78 – Situation in Toronto   11 June 2003 WHO is deeply concerned by the resurgence of SARS cases in Toronto, reported to WHO on 22 May, and is following the situation closely. Toronto, which had been removed from the list of areas with recent local transmission on 14 May, was again added to the list on 26 May following evidence that more than one generation of new cases had occurred. Since the disease first resurged in Toronto, over 90 new probable cases have been reported.   Health authorities in Toronto are again on high alert, and are treating all hospital-associated clusters of patients with fever or respiratory symptoms as possible SARS cases until proven otherwise. Possible cases are immediately isolated. All contacts are being traced and, when warranted, placed in home quarantine. Infection control measures are being followed in all affected facilities. WHO welcomes these precautionary measures.   Canadian authorities have most recently reported a possible cluster of SARS patients in a hospital east of Toronto. Although no clear epidemiological link has been established that could explain this new cluster, officials have adopted a cautious approach. Over the last 3 days, 15 dialysis patients at the Lakeridge Health Centre in Whitby exhibited respiratory and febrile illnesses. After clinical review and laboratory investigations to detect other causative agents, around half of these patients have now been excluded from consideration as possible SARS cases. The remaining patients are being closely monitored.   These and other investigations are ongoing and many questions remain to be answered before firm conclusions can be reached.   WHO is also awaiting further information on cases in other countries that may have been exported from Toronto. WHO is not yet convinced that such cases have been conclusively documented.   One of the most dangerous stages in the evolution of any outbreak, and most especially one caused by a new and poorly understood disease, occurs when cases begin to decline and previous levels of high alert and precautionary measures likewise begin to level off. Much about the clinical behaviour of SARS and its mode of transmission requires further research. Until knowledge improves, precautionary measures such as those being followed in Toronto are the best approach from a public health perspective.  "

"2003","http://www.who.int/csr/don/2003_06_10/en/index.html"," Update 77 - WHO officials to visit China   10 June 2003   Dr David Heymann, Executive Director for Communicable Diseases at WHO, is travelling today to China, where he will confer with health officials about the SARS outbreak and discuss plans for the future. Other members of the team include Dr Guénaël Rodier, Director of Communicable Disease Surveillance and Response, and Dr Thomas Grein, who coordinates global response operations for SARS.   The purpose of the visit is to take stock of the current SARS situation in China and exchange views on the next steps forward. In particular, WHO would like to develop, in collaboration with the Chinese government, a research agenda that fully exploits the many intriguing lines of evidence uniquely associated with the SARS experience in China. WHO officials also want to assess areas where Chinese authorities may require more support to ensure that the disease is securely contained and to protect against a future recrudescence of cases.   “SARS is a serious disease with many puzzling features,” said Dr Heymann. “Long-term containment depends on finding answers to a long list of scientific questions. China has much to offer the rest of the world.”   Some immediate issues for discussion concern case definitions, procedures for contact tracing, and the extent of local transmission in specific areas. The WHO team further seeks reassurance that hospital equipment and supplies for infection control are adequate, especially in the poorer provinces.   Measures may need to be found for sustaining China’s present monumental effort to contain SARS, particularly as programmes for responding to other priority diseases, such as HIV/AIDS and TB, may suffer in the long run.   Weaknesses in the health infrastructure, notably inadequate surveillance, reporting, and hospital facilities in some of China’s poorer provinces, have been of concern since the first report of a WHO assessment team was issued in early April. Both WHO and the Chinese Ministry of Health regard the emergency response to SARS as an excellent opportunity to strengthen, throughout the mainland, systems for detecting and responding to all emerging and epidemic-prone infectious diseases. Such long-term and comprehensive improvements will also strengthen China’s capacity to respond to the next influenza pandemic, which many experts now regard as imminent.   WHO officials are also hoping to learn which measures taken by China have so rapidly brought the country’s SARS outbreak – the largest in the world – under control.   The first cases of SARS were detected in Guangdong Province, China, in mid-November of last year. That outbreak has since been brought under control. Initial studies suggest a lower case fatality ratio than seen elsewhere, and high cure rates. In addition, a report on the epidemiology of the outbreak, issued in mid-May by the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, provides evidence suggesting that close contact with wild game animals is linked to the first sporadic cases, supporting a hypothesis that the SARS virus may have jumped to humans from an animal reservoir. In addition, the outbreak in Guangdong Province shows some features, in terms of incubation period and groups at highest risk, that differ from the clinical picture seen in outbreaks elsewhere.   Answers to these and other questions will help build a solid scientific basis for understanding SARS, predicting its future evolution, and knowing how to respond should cases surface in new areas or resurface in areas where the disease has been contained.   Unlike many new diseases that have emerged in the past two decades, SARS shows no sign of burning out on its own. If the disease is pushed back out of its new human host, this will result from the persistent application of simple yet highly effective control tools – prompt detection and isolation of cases, strict infection control in hospitals, and tracing and appropriate follow-up of all contacts.   Both Viet Nam and Singapore have successfully broken the chain of transmission and have since remained free of SARS. However, the risk of importation of cases remains as long as cases are occurring anywhere in the world.   The visit to China is one in a series in which WHO officials, including the current Director-General, Dr Go Harlem Brundtland, and the Director-General elect, Dr J.W. Lee, confer with health authorities at SARS outbreak sites having the greatest experience to date.   Dr. Brundtland will be visiting Hong Kong SAR later this month.  "

Since 6 June, China has reported one new probable case of the disease.   Taiwan reported 4 new probable SARS cases today, in a hospital on the outskirts of Taipei. All cases arose in previously identified contacts of cases, and are being isolated and quarantined. Together with local health authorities, WHO epidemiologists are investigating the cause of this latest hospital cluster.   There is one new probable case of SARS in Hong Kong. This is the 25th consecutive day on which the number of cases has fallen below 5 since 16 May. Hong Kong also reported one SARS death today.  "
"2003","http://www.who.int/csr/don/2003_06_06/en/index.html"," Update 75 - Update on Situation in Singapore   6 June 2003   As cases of SARS continue to decline, areas that have brought the disease under control, often at great cost, are now seeking ways to protect these hard-won gains against the hazards of imported cases. Because even a single new case could spark another outbreak, it is important for national authorities to remain vigilant even as current numbers of probable cases are diminishing.   Officials from Singapore and Malaysia met today at Woodlands, a Singapore border checkpoint, to strengthen cross-border efforts aimed at containing the spread of SARS. Officials from both countries agreed that travellers detected with fever at the land checkpoint would be isolated and subsequently sent back to their point of embarkation. The Singaporean and Malaysian delegations agreed to update each other on health screening measures introduced at land, air and sea checkpoints. Singapore has also announced that it will continue all current pre-departure screening measures until the regional SARS situation improves.   In addition, since the start of the SARS outbreak, when it became apparent that travel was capable of spreading the disease globally, WHO has collaborated with non-governmental organizations such as the International Air Transport Association and the International Civil Aviation Organization to promote the adoption of measures aimed at preventing the spread of SARS via air travel.   Singapore’s Changi International Airport will soon become the world’s first airport to implement new measures to guard against the spread of SARS, in accordance with procedures set out by the International Civil Aviation Organization. Changi was chosen as the test case partly due to Singapore’s rapid response to SARS; it was the first airport to introduce thermal scanners to screen passengers for fevers. Since then, Singapore has also provided such scanners on loan to Toronto for use in that city’s airport exit screening.   If Changi is determined to be taking all the necessary steps in accordance with the International Civil Aviation Organization guidelines, which are in turn based on WHO recommendations, the airport will receive a certificate. The global aviation body is readying a scheme to evaluate how well airports enforce anti-SARS measures, which include specific procedures for screening passengers and airport workers. The measures also include distributing SARS information to passengers and guidance on handling suspected cases already on board aircraft and at their destinations.  "
"2003","http://www.who.int/csr/don/2003_06_05/en/index.html"," Update 74 - Global decline in cases and deaths continues   5 June 2003   As of today, a cumulative total of 8403 probable cases with 775 deaths has been reported from 29 countries. This represents an increase of 6 new cases and 3 deaths compared with yesterday.   The new cases occurred in Canada (5) and Taiwan (1). New deaths were reported in China (2) and Hong Kong (1).   Health authorities in some of the earliest areas to experience severe outbreaks are maintaining measures to protect against a resurgence of cases. Hong Kong authorities have announced their intention to maintain current screening procedures at all border points for at least one year.   The measures, which began at the end of March, include use of infrared temperature scanners at border points, and obligatory health declarations from all travellers. No new imported cases have occurred since these measures were introduced.   Hong Kong is also setting up a master list of imported cases. Approximately 6% of all SARS cases in Hong Kong are now thought to have been imported. To date, Hong Kong has experienced 1748 cases and 284 deaths, making it the second more severely hit area, with mainland China at the top.   Hong Kong shares a border with Guangdong Province, China. The disease was first brought to Hong Kong in late February when an infected medical doctor from the province spread the virus to at least 13 guests and visitors, all on the same floor of the hotel where he stayed. They carried the disease with them when they returned home, seeding the earliest outbreaks in Viet Nam, Singapore, and Toronto as well as Hong Kong.   In these initial outbreaks, SARS first took root in hospital settings, where staff, unaware that a new disease had surfaced and fighting to save the lives of patients, exposed themselves to the infectious agent without barrier protection. All of these initial outbreaks were subsequently characterized by chains of secondary transmission outside the health care setting.   At present, local chains of transmission are occurring only in Toronto and several parts of China. All other countries with imported cases have managed either to prevent transmission entirely or limit additional cases to very small numbers.  "
"2003","http://www.who.int/csr/don/2003_06_04/en/index.html"," Update 73 - No new deaths, but vigilance needed for imported cases   4 June 2003 As of today, a cumulative total of 8402 probable SARS cases with 772 deaths has been reported from 29 countries. This represents an increase of 10 new cases compared with yesterday. The new cases were reported in Canada (5), Hong Kong (1), Taiwan (2), Germany (1), and the USA (1).   No new deaths were reported today. This marks the first day with no new SARS deaths since 28 March, when the cumulative totals stood at 1485 cases and 53 deaths.   The peak numbers of deaths occurred during the second week of March, when as many as 20 new deaths were being reported on some days.   With outbreaks at all the initial “hot zones” either contained or coming under control, SARS is clearly in decline, indicating that recommended control measures are effective when combined with political commitment and determination.   The fact that the chain of transmission has been broken in Viet Nam and Singapore underscores the WHO position that SARS can be contained, despite the absence of a vaccine, robust diagnostic test and specific treatment. Control currently depends on prompt detection and isolation of cases, good infection control in hospitals, and the tracing and quarantine of contacts.   Viet Nam has remained free of new SARS cases since 8 April. In Singapore, the last locally acquired probable case was isolated on 11 May. No new cases have since been detected in either country despite a high level of alert and aggressive investigation of all rumoured cases.   The experience in Toronto, where more than 70 new cases have been reported since 26 May, underscores the risk of a resurgence of cases and the constant need for vigilance. A single imported case can reignite an outbreak or bring cases to a new area, if preparedness measures are weak.   The new case reported today in Germany, in a man recently returned from Taiwan, has resulted in the quarantine of around 50 contacts. The man has been hospitalized in isolation.  "
"2003","http://www.who.int/csr/don/2003_06_03/en/index.html"," Update 72 - Situation in China   3 June 2003   The daily number of reported new probable cases of SARS in mainland China has declined considerably in recent weeks, from an average of 166 cases during the first week of May, to 90 cases during the second week, 27 cases in the third week, and 16 in the fourth week. Over the past 6 days, the daily number of reported new cases has dropped to an average of 2.5.   As in other areas with large and challenging SARS outbreaks, this progress over the past month demonstrates the decisive importance of high-level political commitment and determined application of control measures that have proven their effectiveness. At the same time, experiences elsewhere demonstrate the need for maintaining a vigilant and cautious approach to SARS, particularly in a country as large and diverse as China.   The resurgence of cases in Toronto demonstrates how difficult it can be to maintain control over a new disease characterized by many puzzling epidemiological and clinical features. The continued alertness of Singapore, which has most recently broken the chain of SARS transmission, demonstrates the importance of staying on guard, with a high level of vigilance and preparedness, to ensure that a single imported case does not reignite an outbreak.   Based on recent experiences and the many uncertainties about the behaviour of SARS, WHO sees a need for caution in interpreting the downward trend in the number of reported new cases in China.   “SARS is still present in China, and WHO continues to regard China as the epicentre of SARS,” said Dr David Heymann, Executive Director for Communicable Diseases at WHO. “It is our job, together with Chinese authorities, to try to prevent this disease from becoming permanently established in such a vast country.”   The next few months will prove crucial in the attempt to contain SARS worldwide, which now greatly depends on whether the disease can be controlled in China. Otherwise, cases in China – with its long porous borders and large migrant populations – could seed outbreaks elsewhere and would thus make SARS a continuing threat for the rest of the world.   Dr Heymann believes that the international community has much to learn from Chinese experiences in controlling SARS, initially in Guangdong Province and increasingly in other parts of China. “It is also our job to work with the government to determine the factors that have led to such a rapid fall in SARS cases compared to other sites where outbreaks have occurred.”   WHO Director-General Dr Gro Harlem Brundtland has stressed the importance, for the security of all populations, of fully understanding the situation within any country experiencing an outbreak of a disease that can threaten neighbouring countries or be spread internationally by the travelling public. “This allows, within a country, for WHO to do what needs to be done to help the rest of the world,” she said, speaking on a SARS-related issue during last week’s World Health Assembly.   Although great improvements in surveillance, reporting, infection control, and public awareness have occurred in China in recent weeks, WHO remains concerned about the sensitivity of case detection in some provinces, and about the capacity of the health infrastructure to cope with a challenge on the scale of SARS. A particular problem is the large number of new cases reported – approximately half – without information on the source or setting of exposure. The absence of this information makes it difficult for WHO to assess the extent of local transmission.   Local transmission of SARS, especially when it occurs outside a confined setting, such as the health care environment, is one measure of the risk of infection for both residents and international travellers. The pattern of local transmission is also an important consideration when WHO issues travel advice designed to prevent further international spread of SARS.  "
"2003","http://www.who.int/csr/don/2003_06_02a/en/index.html"," Update 71 - Status of diagnostic tests, training course in China   2 June 2003   Status of diagnostic tests The development of commercial diagnostic tests for SARS has progressed more slowly than initially hoped. Part of the problem arises from certain unusual features of SARS that make this disease an especially difficult scientific challenge.   For many viral diseases, the greatest quantities of the causative agent are excreted during the initial phase of illness, usually in the first few days following the onset of symptoms. This is often the period during which patients pose the greatest risk of infecting others.   SARS, however, follows a different pattern. During the initial phase of illness, virus shedding is comparatively low. Virus shedding peaks in respiratory specimens and in stools at around 10 days after onset of clinical illness. In effect, this unusual behaviour creates the need for tests having a particularly high sensitivity.   Such tests do not yet exist. Because small quantities of the virus are initially shed, available tests, though developed with impressive speed, are unable reliably to detect SARS virus or its genetic material, during the earliest days of illness. The low sensitivity of current virus detection tests is a particular challenge for SARS control, as patients are capable of infecting others during the initial phase and therefore need to be reliably detected and quickly isolated.   In SARS patients, detectable immune responses do not begin until day 5 or 6. Reliable antibody tests can detect virus only by around day 10 following the onset of symptoms.   WHO continues to recommend use of its case definitions, based on clinical presentation, distinct chest X-rays, and history of possible contact with SARS patients, to detect suspect and probable cases and make management decisions.   To expedite the development of better diagnostic tests, laboratories in the WHO collaborating network have made critical biological materials and reagents available to any laboratory having a sustained interest in the development of diagnostic tests, including the commercial sector. A comprehensive bank of clinical specimens, including respiratory specimens and samples of blood, urine, and faeces from SARS patients, has been established. The bank holds specimens representing all stages of the disease, ranging from the onset of symptoms to recovery.   During the development of diagnostic tests, such specimens are needed to assess how well a test will perform with real patients specimens, as opposed to under the artificial conditions of a laboratory.   Specimens from the bank, which was set up by the Hong Kong Department of Health and the Hospital Authority, are being supplied by a collaborating laboratory, at no charge, to developers of diagnostic tests. As a sample from a single specimen can be subdivided into 6 to 8 identical sub-samples, laboratories can work in parallel on identical specimens, which will further facilitate the assessment of comparative performance. Identical samples also support standardization of diagnostic tests to ensure consistent accuracy.   Laboratories in the WHO network have also made available standardizing reagents for virus and antibody tests. These reagents, which include samples of the inactivated virus and blood from patients in both acute and convalescent stages of illness, will allow uniform assessment of diagnostic results around the world against a “gold standard”.   Sera have been made available by collaborating laboratories in the United Kingdom and Hong Kong. Inactivated virus was prepared by the Bernard-Nocht Institute in Germany. Distribution of these reagents will be the responsibility of the Robert-Koch Institute, also in Germany. In return for the supply of these exclusive materials, recipients of WHO support have agreed to offer test kits, once available, at preferential prices to developing countries.   Training course in China WHO is currently coordinating a series of training courses in Beijing aimed at establishing an efficient laboratory infrastructure for SARS diagnosis in all provinces throughout China. Work of the WHO laboratory network has made it possible to support the training courses with test materials and reagents.   Training in the use of currently available tests is being provided by representatives of the labs where they were developed – thus ensuring that Chinese professionals benefit from the best first-hand experience the world can offer. Trainers come from laboratories in China, Hong Kong, the UK and the USA.   China has already developed a highly promising ELISA diagnostic test. For early detection of SARS virus, the PCR molecular test offers the greatest potential under average hospital conditions. The Singapore Genomic Institute has made its PCR test available, at no cost, to support SARS diagnosis in China.   Although the number of new cases and deaths has declined considerably in mainland China, WHO and Chinese authorities remain concerned about the situation in some of the remote provinces which lack a sufficiently strong health infrastructure, including surveillance and reporting systems and hospital facilities, for responding to the magnitude of the SARS problem.   Update on cases and countries As of today, a cumulative total of 8384 probable cases and 770 deaths has been reported from 29 countries. This represents an increase of 27 new cases and deaths compared with the last report on Saturday. The new deaths were reported in China (2) and Hong Kong (4).  "

The change in status comes 20 days after the last locally acquired case was placed in isolation, on 11 May.   The 20-day period represents twice the maximum incubation period – a reliable indication, following established epidemiological principles, that a chain of transmission has been broken.   In an outstanding example of prompt and open reporting, the 11 May case was reported to WHO on the very day when Singapore was initially scheduled to come off the list.   “From the start, Singapore’s handling of its SARS outbreak has been exemplary,” said Dr David Heymann, Executive Director for Communicable Diseases at WHO. “This is an inspiring victory that should make all of us optimistic that SARS can be contained everywhere.”   Although continued vigilance, especially to prevent the importation of cases, is extremely important, WHO no longer recommends exit screening of international travellers departing from Singapore, effective tomorrow. The absence of local transmission for twice the incubation period means that neither residents nor travellers are at risk of acquiring SARS in Singapore.   Management of the Singapore outbreak faced a number of especially difficult challenges. The first cases of an unusual form of pneumonia were reported on 9 March. At that time, SARS had not yet been recognized as a new disease easily spread in hospitals. As a result, hospital staff were unaware of the need to isolate patients and protect themselves.   The virus initially spread rapidly among hospital staff, patients, visitors, and their close family contacts. Later on, spread of infection between hospitals occurred when patients with underlying disease – which masked the tell-tale symptoms of SARS – were transferred to other hospitals, placed in rooms with other patients, and managed without adequate protective equipment.   The outbreak in Singapore was further amplified by several so-called “super-spreaders”. These are individuals who, for as yet unexplained reasons, are highly efficient in spreading the virus to others. For example, the disease was brought to Singapore by a young women who stayed on the same floor of Hong Kong’s Metropole Hotel at the same time, during late February, as a medical doctor from Guangdong Province, China. This person, who was the first to carry the SARS virus out of mainland China, infected at least 13 other hotel guests and visitors. Back home in Singapore, the young woman subsequently infected 23 others.   When the SARS virus moved into the community, it did so through an infected vegetable hawker at a crowded wholesale market. Swift action by the government, including closing of the market, contact tracing, and quarantining of more than 400 persons, limited the spread of infection to only 15 other persons.   Altogether, 144 of Singapore’s 206 probable cases have been linked to contact with only 5 individuals.   In a few cases, SARS transmission occurred in situations, such as taxis, elevators, and hospital corridors, where exposure may have been through a route other than face-to-face contact with infected droplets. This unusual pattern necessitated an expanded policy for contact tracing and home quarantine.   Health authorities responded to all these challenges with extraordinary measures, adjusting strategies as each new problem emerged.   In an official communication from the Ministry of Health, sent on 29 May, WHO was informed that investigations had identified the source of infection for all but one of the country’s total number of cases.   This is only one achievement in an outbreak response consistently characterized by extra precautions and extraordinary determination.   Surveillance in Singapore uses a highly sensitive case definition that picks up for investigation and monitoring virtually every person with symptoms that might possibly indicate SARS, regardless of whether the person has been in contact with a SARS patient. An independent hospital-based surveillance system monitors for cases of pneumonia acquired outside the hospital setting. This “wide net” approach may help explain why so few cases have escaped detection and why the time between onset of symptoms and isolation has been so much shorter in Singapore, reducing opportunities for further spread.   Local transmission is of greatest concern when a new case cannot be traced back to another case, or when a symptomatic case circulates in the community for several days prior to isolation   Singapore used its military forces to assist in contact tracing and enforcement of home quarantine. All persons who were household, social, hospital, and occupational contacts during the 10 days before symptom onset were traced to identify the source of infection. Persons identified as having had contact with a SARS patient from onset of symptoms to date of isolation were placed in home quarantine.   Other measures include screening of passengers at the airport and seaports, concentration of patients in a single SARS-designated hospital, imposition of a no-visitors rule for all public hospitals, and use of a dedicated private ambulance service to transport all possible cases to the SARS-designated hospital.   In addition, management of the outbreak benefited from support from high-quality laboratory services, including the Virology Unit, Singapore General Hospital, which is a member of the WHO laboratory network.   One indication of the effectiveness of these measures is the fact that 80% of Singapore’s SARS cases did not transmit the infection to others.   Taken together, these efforts have made Singapore a place safe from the risk of SARS for both residents and visitors.   Experiences elsewhere underscore the importance of maintaining a high level of vigilance. WHO is confident that vigilance and preparedness to act will continue in Singapore. On 6 June, the Ministry of Health will hold a border meeting with officials in Malaysia to discuss measures for keeping Singapore free of imported cases.  "
"2003","http://www.who.int/csr/don/2003_05_29/en/index.html"," Update 69 - Situation in China   29 May 2003   Situation in China China has today reported 3 new probable SARS cases, all in Beijing. All 3 patients had previously been classified as suspect cases and were already hospitalized.   WHO is cautiously optimistic that outbreaks in mainland China are being brought under control in provinces with good surveillance and reporting systems and good infection control in hospitals.   WHO officials in China report that the use of air conditioning in public places is being discontinued in an effort to prevent the further spread of SARS. WHO has no evidence to date that air-conditioning could play a role in spreading the SARS virus. All evidence indicates that the predominant mode of spread is through close person-to-person contact with droplets expelled when an infected person coughs or sneezes.   For the purpose of infection control, and exclusively in hospital settings, WHO does recommend turning off air-conditioning and opening windows to provide ventilation. This option is recommended only when the preferred options of negative pressure rooms or an independent air supply and exhaust system cannot be met.   A WHO expert who recently assessed the SARS situation in Shanghai reports that the city has taken many steps to stem the spread of SARS. While the screening of air passengers is progressing well, implementation of a similar level of screening at Shanghai’s bus and railway stations is proving logistically more difficult. Local authorities are also implementing numerous temperature checks; these may occasionally be performed at an excessive frequency.   WHO teams in China are still investigating how best to implement monitoring procedures in the country’s rural areas. Local officials are prepared to adopt a community-based surveillance system. However, exactly which measures will prove most effective remains to be determined. WHO teams hope to visit other SARS “hot spots” in China, such as Tianjin and Shanxi.   Update on cases and countries As of today, a cumulative total of 8295 cases with 750 deaths has been reported from 28 countries. This represents an increase of 17 new cases and 5 new deaths compared with yesterday. The new deaths occurred in China (2) and Hong Kong SAR (3).  "
"2003","http://www.who.int/csr/don/2003_05_28/en/index.html"," Update 68 - SARS situation in Taiwan   28 May 2003 br>  Situation in Taiwan   Taiwan has today reported 22 new probable cases of SARS and 5 new deaths, marking the continuation of a downward trend that became apparent earlier this week. Throughout last week, the large number of new cases reported daily was due, in part, to a change in reporting procedures, as hundreds of patients in a  pending  category were investigated and then either excluded or reclassified as suspect or probable cases. For this reason, many cases reported for the first time on a given day actually had dates of onset several days earlier. The record number of newly reported cases occurred last Thursday, when 65 probable cases were added to the list.   With the backlog of pending cases now cleared, the low number of genuine new cases reported today (22) and yesterday (13) indicates that the outbreak in Taiwan has begun to decline.   This welcome development can be attributed to improved infection control in hospitals, including better procedures in emergency rooms and use of protective equipment. A good level of screening, aimed at detecting and isolating patients promptly, is also working to make hospitals safe for patients and staff. These activities reinforce standardized infection control procedures in place throughout the island.   To date, more than 90% of SARS cased in Taiwan have been linked to the hospital setting.   High-profile public awareness campaigns were launched earlier to improve public understanding of SARS, with emphasis placed on good personal hygiene, frequent temperature checks, and prompt reporting of fevers. An island-wide telephone hotline and call centre, staffed by doctors and nurses, has been implemented.   Taiwan has established around 100 fever clinics and will soon be opening more. These facilities ease overcrowding in emergency rooms as more and more concerned residents seek urgent medical attention. The clinics also reduce opportunities for contact with more severely ill persons who might be affected by SARS.   A programme for monitoring and evaluation of all SARS-related control activities has been designed and will be implemented shortly. With these measures in place, WHO is confident that the number of cases in Taiwan will continue the present decline, as has been the experience at other outbreak sites.   To date, Taiwan has reported a cumulative total of 610 probable cases and 81 deaths. The outbreak began to escalate near the end of April, when a lapse in infection control at a hospital is thought to have resulted in a large number of new exposures that spread to new sites as patients were transferred to other hospitals. The number of probable cases reached 100 on 2 May, grew to 207 on 13 May, and passed the 300 mark on 19 May. Two days later, Taiwan reported 418 cases, and on 23 May, 538 cases.   This rapid growth in reported cases, partly caused by the clearing of hundreds of cases in the backlog, has now slowed. In this sense, Taiwanese health officials have  caught up  with the outbreak and are now much closer to bringing SARS under control.  Update on cases and countries   As of today, a cumulative total of 8240 probable cases with 745 deaths has been reported from 28 countries. This represents an increase of 30 new cases and 10 deaths compared with yesterday. The new deaths occurred in China (4), Hong Kong SAR (1), and Taiwan (5).  "
"2003","http://www.who.int/csr/don/2003_05_27a/en/index.html"," Update 67 - SARS resolution approved, situation in Taiwan   27 May 2003 Disease Outbreak Reported  SARS resolution approved, situation in Taiwan   World Health Assembly adopts resolution on SARS Today in Geneva, more than 190 countries participating in the World Health Assembly – the supreme governing body of WHO – unanimously approved a resolution on SARS. The Assembly also considered a report (.pdf) on the emergence and spread of SARS and on the international response to date.   The text of the resolution was based on a draft proposed by a group of Asian countries, and then fine-tuned during more than 7 hours of collaborative work by 37 nations. The group was chaired by Dr Viroj Tangcharoensathien, a senior member of Thailand’s Ministry of Public Health.   The resolution, which recognizes SARS as “the first severe infectious disease to emerge in the twenty-first century”, calls for the full support of all countries to control SARS and other emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases. It also urges countries “to report cases promptly and transparently and to provide requested information to WHO.” Countries are further asked to request WHO support when “control measures employed are ineffective in halting the spread of disease.”   In the resolution and in the debate that preceded its adoption, SARS was clearly recognized as a serious threat to the stability and growth of economies, the livelihood of populations, and the functioning of health systems as well as a cause of great human suffering. Lessons learned in the ongoing response to SARS were considered relevant to improved preparedness for the next new disease, the next influenza pandemic, and a possible act of bioterrorism.   While WHO was asked to continue to update the list of areas with recent local transmission of SARS, the resolution acknowledges the need to do so in a way that minimizes the socioeconomic consequences.   A statement made by the Italian delegation, praising the dedication of all health care workers, including several who have lost their lives to SARS, met with a round of applause.   In a related item, also considered today, delegates approved a resolution setting out procedures and a timetable for revision of the International Health Regulations. The Regulations, which are administered by WHO, provide the legal framework for global surveillance and reporting of infectious diseases. They also provide the only mechanism through which measures to prevent international spread can be enforced.   Basically unchanged since 1969, the Regulations are considered grossly inadequate in protecting nations and the international community against the resurgence of the infectious disease threat, which has resulted in the emergence of around 30 new diseases during the past two decades. As many speakers noted, this threat, dramatically illustrated by SARS, is amplified by conditions in a highly mobile, interconnected, and closely interdependent world.   As the revision process will not be completed before 2005, the resolution adopted by consensus today requests WHO, through its Director-General, to take into account information about epidemics from sources other than official government notifications, and to conduct on-the-spot studies within countries to ensure that control measures are adequate to prevent international spread. These newly authorized functions are expected to strengthen WHO’s capacity to respond to outbreaks and epidemics quickly and with sufficient force to prevent spread to neighbouring countries and others.   Situation in Taiwan A WHO official in Taiwan has today reported important strides forward in strengthening hospital infection control and contact tracing. Health officials have launched a widespread information campaign, set up a major screening programme and established fever clinics to keep persons suspected of having SARS out of contact with others. In the assessment of WHO, these efforts are beginning to bear fruit. The situation in Taiwan is expected to improve gradually in the coming days and weeks.   Thirteen new probable cases and 4 new deaths were reported today from Taiwan.   Update on cases and countries As of today, a cumulative total of 8221 probable SARS cases with 735 deaths has been reported from 28 countries. This represents an increase of 24 new cases and 10 deaths compared with yesterday. The new deaths occurred in China (4), Hong Kong SAR (2), and Taiwan (4).  "

Clinical signs included headache, neck and back pain, joint pain, high fever, followed by nasal bleeding, blood vomiting and diarrhoea.   An EWARN joint field investigation team including WHO, the Kenyan Medical Research Institute (KEMRI) and Operation Lifeline Sudan (OLS) rapidly investigated the report from 11 to 15 May and found 178 cases and 27 deaths in Imatong and Ikotos districts, Torrit county, in the south-eastern part of the country.

"2003","http://www.who.int/csr/don/2003_05_26/en/index.html"," Update 66 - Situation in Toronto, interpretation of “areas with recent local transmission”   26 May 2003   Situation in Toronto WHO has today added Toronto, Canada to the list of areas with recent local transmission of SARS. The change in status follows information, communicated by Health Canada, about new clusters of 26 suspect and 8 probable cases of SARS linked to 4 Toronto hospitals.   As a precautionary measure, all cases in the clusters are being treated as possibly representing SARS until proven otherwise. Actions being taken include immediate isolation of all cases, heightened infection control, intensive contact tracing, and voluntary home quarantine of contacts. These measures have proved highly effective in quickly containing outbreaks.   An urgent alert was sent on Friday to all health and long-term care facilities and service providers in Toronto. Potential exposures include staff, patients, and visitors at the four hospitals.   Although the results of laboratory and epidemiological investigations are pending, sufficient information is available to determine that the index, or first, case in the present outbreak has transmitted infection to others in more than one generation of local transmission. Toronto is therefore classified as having “pattern B” transmission. This is defined as more than one generation of local probable SARS cases.   Inclusion of countries and areas in this list, which is stratified according to three patterns of transmission, does not mean that WHO recommends travel restrictions to the country or area.   At present, WHO is not recommending any restrictions on travel to Toronto.   Local transmission of SARS is of greatest concern, in terms of risks to both local populations and international travellers, when a new case cannot be traced back to contact with another case, or turns out to have been a contact of a case but was not placed in isolation. Both situations increase opportunities for local spread to others.   The table listing areas with recent local transmission is updated daily to assist in the identification and reporting of SARS cases. Pending the development of robust and reliable diagnostic tests, a history of recent travel to an area with local transmission of SARS is part of the WHO case definitions for both suspect and probable cases.   On 23 April, WHO advised persons planning to travel to Toronto to consider postponing all but essential travel. This recommendation was lifted on 30 April, following epidemiological evidence that the outbreak had been controlled to an extent that travellers were no longer at risk.   On 14 May, Toronto was removed from the list of areas with recent local transmission and from the list of areas for which WHO has issued recommendations pertaining to international travel. Criteria for removal from the list include no new probable cases for 20 days, which is twice the incubation period. When no new cases occur over a 20-day period, the chain of transmission is considered broken and the outbreak controlled.   Interpretation of “areas with recent local transmission” The list of areas with recent local transmission is issued by WHO to facilitate use of the SARS case definitions to detect and report suspect and probable cases. A recent history of travel to an area where local transmission outside a confined setting, such as the health care environment, is occurring can assist physicians in the interpretation of symptoms in international travellers.   Update on cases and countries As of today, a cumulative total of 8202 probable cases with 725 deaths has been reported from 28 countries. This represents an increase of 96 probable cases and 29 deaths compared with the most recent report on Saturday. The new deaths occurred in Canada (3), China (9), Hong Kong SAR (5), and Taiwan (12).   Taiwan, reporting 62 probable cases over the past two days, continues to have the most rapidly growing outbreak. With a cumulative total of 585 probable cases, Taiwan now has more than twice the caseload of Singapore (206 probable cases), which was among the most severely affected initial outbreak sites.  "

The second cluster of 26 cases, including 10 health care workers, is associated with North York General Hospital. One patient undergoing investigation has been linked to both hospitals.   As a precaution, both clusters are being managed as possibly representing cases of SARS until proven otherwise. Results of laboratory, clinical and epidemiological investigations are expected early next week.   The status of Toronto, which was removed last week from the WHO list of areas with recent local transmission, remains unchanged pending further information made available as the investigations progress.

As a precaution, the cluster is being managed as possibly representing cases of SARS until proven otherwise. Intensive laboratory and clinical investigations are under way. As of today, no links had been established between these five patients and recent probable cases of SARS, which are all well documented.   WHO was informed today by Canadian authorities that further information should be available early next week. Pending the results of this investigations, there is no change in the status of Toronto, which was removed last week from the WHO list of areas with recent local transmission.   Comments on the reported isolation of viruses related to the SARS coronavirus in wild animals in southern China Research teams in Hong Kong and Shenzhen, China have today announced the results of a joint study of wild animals taken from a market, in southern China, selling wild animals for human consumption. The study detected several coronaviruses closely related genetically to the SARS coronavirus in two of the animal species tested (masked palm civet and racoon-dog). The study also found that one additional species (Chinese ferret badger) elicited antibodies against the SARS coronavirus. These and other wild animals are traditionally considered delicacies and are sold for human consumption in markets throughout southern China.   All six of the civets included in the study were found to harbour SARS coronavirus isolated in cell culture or detected by a PCR molecular technique. The animals also seroconverted and their sera inhibited the growth of SARS coronavirus isolated from humans. Vice versa, human serum from SARS patients inhibited the growth of SARS isolates from these animals.   Sequencing of viruses isolated from these animals demonstrated that, with the exception of a small additional sequence, the viruses are identical with the human SARS virus.   Information on the potential role of animals in the transmission of SARS is important to overall understanding of SARS. Much more research is needed before any firm conclusions can be reached. At present, no evidence exists to suggest that these wild animal species play a significant role in the epidemiology of SARS outbreaks. However, it cannot be ruled out that these animals might have been a source of human infection.   As a precautionary measure, persons who might come into contact with these species or their products, including body fluids and excretions, should be aware of the possible health risks, particularly during close contact such as handling and slaughtering and possibly food processing and consumption.   The study provides a first indication that the SARS virus exists outside a human host. However, many fundamental questions remain. Samples were taken from one market only. Studies need to determine how widespread the SARS virus might be in animals in Guangdong and elsewhere, and if these animals can excrete virus in an amount sufficient to infect humans. Furthermore, the possibility of animal-to-animal transmission has to be investigated. For example, the presence of virus could result from consumption of an infected prey.   Update on cases and countries  As of today, a cumulative total of 8117 probable cases with 689 deaths have been reported from 28 countries. This represents an increase of 77 new cases and 7 deaths when compared with yesterday. The new deaths occurred in China (3), Hong Kong (2), and Singapore (2).   Most of the new cases were reported in Taiwan, China. With 55 new cases reported today, Taiwan now has a cumulative total of 538 probable cases, making it the third most severe outbreak site to date.  "

The recommendation to consider postponing all but essential travel to Hong Kong and Guangdong was issued on 2 April in order to minimize the international spread of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). WHO is changing this recommendation as the situation in these areas has now improved significantly.   Recommendations to postpone travel are issued following consideration of several factors, including the magnitude of probable SARS cases, the pattern of recent local transmission, and the last dates of export of cases.   On 27 March, WHO recommended that all areas with recent local transmission 1 should screen all international departing passengers to ensure that those who are sick with SARS or are contacts of SARS cases do not travel. This recommendation is still valid for both Hong Kong and Guangdong.   “We are changing the travel advice for Hong Kong and Guangdong effective Friday, 23 May,” said Dr Gro Harlem Brundtland, Director-General of the WHO. “Guangdong was the first place in the world to have cases of SARS but I am pleased to note that due to the efforts of the local and national health authorities, with support from WHO and partners, the outbreaks in Guangdong and in Hong Kong are being contained.    In Hong Kong, the three-day average number of new cases has remained below five over the last six days and the pattern of the outbreak shows a sustained decline since the peak of new cases in late March. The total number of people who are still infectious (all of whom are in hospital) has fallen below 60, although there are other former SARS patients who are still convalescing or being treated for other conditions in hospital. All new cases in the past 20 days have occurred in people who were already identified as contacts of a person with SARS and under active surveillance by the local health authorities. There have been no recent reports of internationally exported cases from Hong Kong.   In Guangdong province, the three-day average number of new cases has been below five for 11 days and the number of SARS patients in hospital fell below 60 on May 20. Due to the efforts of the provincial health authorities, the extent of local transmission has fallen to low levels over recent weeks. There have been no recent reports of internationally exported cases from Guangdong province.   The WHO has also reviewed the travel recommendations for other areas of China, including Beijing, Hebei, Inner Mongolia, Shanxi, Taiwan and Tianjin. The WHO recommendations to consider postponing non-essential travel to these areas remain in place. The WHO reviews travel recommendations regularly.   The outbreak in many areas of China is ongoing, and will require continuing intensive efforts as well as a rapid injection of new resources to fully contain SARS.   1 In Patterns B and C Pattern B: More than one generation of local probable SARS cases, but only among persons that have been previously identified and followed-up as known contacts of probable SARS cases. Pattern C: Local probable cases occurring among persons who have not been previously identified as known contacts of probable SARS cases.  "

These figures represent an increase of 95 new cases and 16 deaths when compared with yesterday. The new deaths occurred in China (4), Hong Kong SA (3), Taiwan (8), and Singapore (1).   The cumulative total of probable cases surpassed 5000 on 28 April, 6000 on 2 May, and 7000 on 8 May.   Situation in Taiwan Taiwan authorities have today reported a record 60 new probable cases of SARS and 8 deaths, bringing the cumulative totals to 483 cases and 60 deaths. However, the large daily increases in new cases seen over the past week are due to a backlog in the investigation of pending cases and determination of which fit the case definition for probable SARS.   While the daily numbers of new cases indicate the size of the SARS outbreak in Taiwan, which is worrisome, they do not suggest an explosive escalation in the number of cases, as both older and new cases are being reported together on a daily basis. At present, the daily increases reflect a change in the way records have been kept, with cases in a “pending” category now being classified as either suspect or probable cases. As the backlog of pending cases is now being rapidly cleared, the daily reports should begin within days to give a more accurate picture of the evolution of the outbreak in Taiwan.   Since detection of its first suspect cases, Taiwan has promptly reported on the outbreak to WHO. The first two cases, who were hospitalized on 8 March, occurred in a man with a recent travel history to Guangdong Province and Hong Kong, and his wife, who had no recent travel history. The cases were officially recognized as suspect SARS cases on 14 March, two days after WHO issued a global alert about the emergence of a new disease with severe respiratory symptoms. A team from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, organized by WHO’s Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network, arrived in Taiwan on 16 March.   Taiwan initially experienced a gradual increase in the number of cases. As of 18 April, 29 cases had been reported. All were identified, through contact tracing and investigation of travel history, as either imported cases, cases in persons with a recent travel history to areas with local transmission, and family members and other close contacts of patients. The number of cases began to climb at the end of April, when local transmission in hospitals became the source of the majority of new infections. The number of probable cases reached 100 on 2 May, grew to 207 on 13 May, and now stands at 483.   Taiwan has now received supplementary protective equipment shipped urgently from Thailand yesterday. The problem of infection control in hospitals is being addressed as a top priority. Procedures were set up today to ensure rapid and efficient distribution of the new equipment.   WHO will be sending an additional 2 staff from Geneva to Taiwan over the weekend.   Data on in-flight transmission updated Following receipt of more complete data, WHO is updating its statistics on cases of in-flight transmission of SARS. The number of flights during which transmission of SARS may have occurred remains at four. The total number of cases resulting from exposure during these four flights has been revised to 27. One flight alone, CA112, which flew from Hong Kong to Beijing on 15 March, is now know to have accounted for 22 of the 27 cases.   WHO is aware of an additional 31 flights with symptomatic probable SARS cases on board. No evidence indicates that in-flight transmission occurred on any of these flights. No flights have been implicated in the transmission of SARS after 23 March 2003.   Complete data on seating information for all cases has not been obtained. However, it is now known that, on one flight, persons sitting seven rows in front and five row behind a person with symptomatic SARS developed the disease. WHO is aware of four flight attendants, of which two were on the CA112 flight, who have become infected.   Report from the joint team in Henan Province, China “Community-based surveillance and control methods seem to be an important contributor to the apparently low levels of SARS infection in China’s rural countryside,” Dr. James Maguire says. Dr Maguire returned to Beijing three days ago from a six-day visit to China’s Henan Province. He travelled as part of a joint Ministry of Health-WHO team. The group visited hospitals, clinics and basic health facilities in five prefectures in Henan.   A full report of the team’s findings is being prepared and will soon be released.   Dr Maguire says that numerous checkpoints on roads and at train and bus stations, where identification cards are checked and body temperatures recorded, seem to be an effective way of controlling the spread of SARS. “The fear of the disease is widespread. Combined with community surveillance and social and legal pressure, people are cooperating,” he says.   Henan officials told the investigators around 1.4 million workers had returned to the province during the long holiday period around May 1. Many came from areas with higher rates of SARS infection, like Beijing and Guangdong. During the period from 26 April to 15 May, the team was told that at the checkpoints 12,028 people were found to be feverish and 955 had a cough. They were referred to “fever clinics” – basic triage centers where they were put into single-room isolation for further assessment. “We were told that nine of these cases were confirmed as being infected with SARS and eight were suspected cases,” Dr Maguire says.   Ministry of Health statistics show there were 15 probable cases, including one in a health worker, and six suspect cases of SARS reported from Henan province as of May 22.   Usually, returning workers from affected areas must stay under house quarantine for 15 days, staying apart from their family in a single room. Dr Maguire says to help with farming work, some local governments are offering financial assistance to have hired workers perform the necessary fieldwork or grants to enable people to buy farm machinery to lower the demand for human farm labour.   “The screening at checkpoints and quarantining may seem like hitting a fly with a hammer, but they seem to be working,” Dr Maguire says. “Combined with the extreme social pressure brought on by the fear of SARS, China might have hit on a way to fight the spread of the disease.”  "
"2003","http://www.who.int/csr/don/2003_05_21a/en/index.html"," Update 61 - WHO extends its SARS related travel advice to all of Taiwan province, China   21 May 2003 Note for the Press   As a result of ongoing assessments as to the nature of outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), WHO is now recommending, as a measure of precaution, that people planning to travel to Taiwan province, China, consider postponing all but essential travel. This is an extension of the advice issued on 8 May recommending the postponing of non-essential travel to Taipei, and is based on information received by the WHO detailing the spread of SARS beyond that city. This temporary travel advice will be reassessed regularly.   Following global alerts about SARS, issued by WHO on 12 and 15 March, national authorities have heightened surveillance for suspect and probable cases. In many countries, prompt detection and isolation of initial cases have prevented further transmission altogether or held additional cases to a very small number. On 27 March, WHO recommended additional measures aimed at preventing the travel-related spread of SARS. These recommended measures, which include the screening of air passengers departing from areas with recent local transmission of SARS, continue to apply. (see SARS site )   Information about the magnitude of the SARS outbreaks in Taiwan province, China, has been carefully reviewed by WHO. The travel advice is based on a consideration of the magnitude of the outbreaks in the area, including both the number of prevalent cases and the daily number of new cases. The extent of local chains of transmission as well as the potential for spread beyond these areas were also major factors in the reasoning for this advice.   WHO travel advice is issued to protect international public health and to reduce opportunities for further global spread. SARS is a new disease, first recognized in late February, that has spread along the routes of international air travel. Precautionary measures aim to reduce the impact of SARS and contain the disease while it is still in a relatively early stage.   The SARS situation is assessed on a regular basis to determine whether the status of areas listed for travel advice needs to be modified, whether other areas need to be added, and if additional precautionary measures are required. Current travel advice, whereby WHO recommends that people consider postponing all but essential travel, are now in effect for several areas of China, namely: Beijing, Hong Kong, Guangdong, Hebei, Inner Mongolia, Shanxi, Taiwan and Tianjin.

"2003","http://www.who.int/csr/don/2003_05_20/en/index.html"," Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS)-multi-country outbreak - Update 60   20 May 2003 Disease Outbreak Reported  Philippines removed from list of areas with recent local transmission   WHO has today removed the Philippines from its list of areas with recent local transmission of SARS. The last probable case that was locally acquired was isolated on 30 April, meaning that opportunities for spread of the virus to others were significantly reduced. As 20 days have now passed with no further cases detected, WHO can safely conclude that local transmission has been interrupted. The twenty days represent twice the maximum incubation period – a reliable indication, following established epidemiological principles, that a chain of transmission has been broken.   To date, the Philippines Department of Health has reported a total of 12 probable SARS cases to WHO. All have been promptly and extensively investigated by local officials, and all have been linked to source cases. Of the 12 SARS cases, 5 were imported. One of the imported cases, who carried the disease from Toronto, infected 7 other cases in the only chain of secondary transmission that has occurred in the Philippines. Of the 7 secondary cases, all have been identified as either family members of the index case or health care workers who treated the index case or her father, both of whom died. These are the only 2 SARS deaths reported in the Philippines.   The SARS situation in the Philippines illustrates the scale of the emergency effort needed to respond effectively to an imported case and ensure that an outbreak is swiftly contained, keeping the number of secondary cases small. The imported case travelled to 5 provinces prior to hospitalization. Contract tracing identified 250 casual and close contacts who were closely followed up. Four of these developed fever and were quarantined until a diagnosis of SARS was excluded.   The Department of Health has today reported to WHO that active surveillance has been ongoing since 17 March to detect and investigate any new SARS cases in 16 regions of the Philippines. All regions report daily on whether any suspect cases have been identified. A report of a suspect case initiates immediate contact tracing and, when necessary, quarantine measures.   The efficient surveillance and reporting system in the Philippines, which reflects strong political commitment and a high level of awareness among health staff, confers an additional level of assurance that no local transmission is now occurring.   WHO has never advised that travel to the Philippines be restricted.   The list of areas with recent local transmission is issued by WHO to facilitate use of the SARS case definition to detect and report suspect and probable cases. A recent history of travel to an area where local transmission outside a confined setting, such as the health care environment, has been documented can help physicians assess symptoms of illness in international travellers.   In the absence of a robust and reliable laboratory diagnostic test, WHO continues to recommend that these cases definitions be used to identify SARS cases and guide appropriate management decisions.   Update on cases and countries As of today, a cumulative total of 7919 probable cases with 662 deaths have been reported from 28 countries. This represents an increase of 60 new cases and 19 deaths when compared with yesterday.   The new deaths occurred in China (5), Hong Kong SAR (2), and Taiwan (12). Taiwan, with 39 new probable cases reported today, also has the highest number of new cases  "
"2003","http://www.who.int/csr/don/2003_05_19a/en/index.html"," Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS)-multi-country outbreak - Update 59   19 May 2003 Disease Outbreak Reported  Report on Guangxi (China) visit, situation in Taiwan, risk of SARS transmission during air travel   Report on Guangxi (China) visit Guangxi Province appears to be responding well to its relatively small SARS outbreak, with the disease given high priority by both populations and health officials. This conclusion was reached by WHO experts following a joint field visit with Ministry of Health officials. To date, Guangxi has reported 22 probable SARS cases and 3 deaths.   Some concern had been expressed that this “poverty province”, with its weak health infrastructure, would not be able to cope with a SARS outbreak. “We found the province well mobilized. There appears to be no major epidemic there,” said WHO team leader CK Lee. The team returned last Saturday to Beijing after a week-long visit in the province.   Experts found an effective surveillance system set up to detect cases. Diagnostic procedures, treatment, and infection control at all hospitals visited was considered adequate. While no evidence of concealment of cases was found, the numbers of probable SARS cases could be higher due to problems with how cases are being defined.   The team found that two separate clusters of SARS cases, dating from December and January, had recently been detected by local health officials following a review of hospital records.   Guangxi’s surveillance system, which is similar to that of Hebei Province, relies on active, rigorous community-based surveillance, close checking of migrants returning home, and quarantine for two weeks in certain cases. An adequate case reporting system has been set up, with detailed reports sent daily from each city or prefecture to the provincial level.   According to official records, some 260,000 migrant workers returned to Guangxi between April 1 and May 8, of whom 200,000 workers came from neighbouring Guangdong province. Surveillance checkpoints have been set up at main entry points into the province to register these workers. Screening teams staffed by township hospital doctors also visit villages to monitor returning workers.   Hospital management appeared to be effective. Due to scrupulous infection control, no health care workers have been reported as infected. However, some measures taken may be unwarranted, unsustainable or even inappropriate. For example, health care workers are using three layers of hats, gowns, gloves and masks. Two of the three masks are made up of a 12-layer gauze material.   Experts are also concerned that the numbers of reported cases may be low, due to how cases are being classified under the probable, suspect and “under observation” categories. WHO experts are further investigating this issue and working with the Ministry of Health to bring the national standard case definitions more in line with WHO case definitions.   In a separate development, WHO has requested that joint research be undertaken to investigate the origins of the coronavirus to predict its possible reintroduction into the community.   Situation in Taiwan Taiwan has today reported a cumulative total of 344 probable SARS cases with 40 deaths. On 17 May Taiwan reported 34 new cases, and 36 new cases were reported the following day, making Taiwan the most rapidly growing outbreak at present.   As the SARS situation in Taiwan has evolved quickly, with cases now being reported in at least six hospitals, it is possible that the large number of cases being reported daily represents a backlog of cases that are only now being recognized as SARS.   Lapses in infection control, particularly in emergency rooms, may have been one reason for the rapid increase in cases, particularly in hospitals.   Local authorities are focusing on improving their infection control measures. Cases are now less likely to go unrecognized in emergency rooms, many of which have been reorganized to minimize the risk of further SARS transmission. A new monitoring system will also establish guidelines and procedures for the assignment of hospital beds in isolation wards.   The department of health has established a 24-hour case reporting system to handle SARS reports made by physicians and hospitals. Delays in case reporting are punishable by law, and in the severest cases, subject to imprisonment.   Taiwan authorities have adopted thorough contact tracing and quarantine measures to prevent further spread. The joint WHO-CDC team in Taiwan is working to ensure that detailed practical guidelines, developed by Hong Kong, Singapore, and other successful initial outbreak sites, are being made available to Taiwanese authorities. In particular, guidance on the safe screening of persons presenting with fever, and advice on policies for home quarantine and prevention of spread within schools are being shared by teams at other outbreak sites.   Officials in Kaohsiung, Taiwan’s second largest city, have adopted contingency plans for the city, county and region. Should Kaohsiung exceed the simulated level of preparedness, the next level involves military intervention. The city’s level of preparedness in hospitals appears to be good   WHO is confident that Taiwan will bring the outbreak under control using methods of case detection, isolation and good infection control in hospitals, vigorous contact tracing and follow-up surveillance, and public education and information that have proven their effectiveness in other areas. Additional WHO support staff will be sent to Taiwan soon.   Risk of SARS transmission during air travel Globally, WHO has analysed information, as of 12 May, on 35 flights in which a probable symptomatic SARS case was among the passengers or crew. To date, symptomatic probable SARS cases on four of these flights have been associated with possible transmission of infection to fellow passengers or crew.   The most recent flight during which SARS may have been transmitted from a probable symptomatic case to another fellow passenger, seated next to each other, occurred on 23 March during a flight from Bangkok to Beijing.   On 27 March, WHO issued recommendations for the screening of air passengers departing from areas with recent local transmission. In some areas that have experienced severe SARS outbreaks, including Hong Kong SAR and Singapore, measures being applied at airports exceed those recommended by WHO. In these areas, prompt detection and isolation of cases, and rigorous tracing and home confinement or quarantine of all contacts have served as the first line of protection against the risk that an infectious person could board an aircraft. Stringent measures for export screening confer yet another level of protection.   Update on cases and countries As of today, a cumulative total of 7864 probable SARS cases with 643 deaths have been reported from 28 countries. This represents an increase of 116 new cases and 20 deaths when compared with the last global update on Saturday.   The new deaths occurred in China (7), Hong Kong (8), and Taiwan (5).  "

"2003","http://www.who.int/csr/don/2003_05_17/en/index.html"," Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS)-multi-country outbreak - Update 58   17 May 2003 Disease Outbreak Reported  First global consultation on SARS epidemiology, travel recommendations for Hebei Province (China), situation in Singapore   First global consultation on SARS epidemiology The first global consultation on SARS epidemiology, held at WHO headquarters in Geneva from 16 to 17 May, concluded its work today. The meeting united face-to-face and via video and audio linkage more than 40 leading epidemiologists from 16 countries, including representatives from all areas experiencing significant outbreaks and from WHO teams at these sites.   The meeting was convened to answer a series of fundamental questions important to understanding the dynamics of SARS transmission in populations and the appropriateness of currently recommended measures for control. As SARS is a new disease and outbreaks are evolving, such consultations are needed to ensure that WHO’s global recommendations reflect the latest and best scientific knowledge.   Participants reviewed data from a number of recently completed and ongoing investigations, and exchanged first-hand experiences. Data were presented on the incubation period, the period during which patients are infectious, and case fatality ratios. Participants also exchanged views on routes of transmission and the question of whether subclinical infection contributes to SARS transmission. To date, no reports indicate that persons without symptoms have transmitted SARS to others. In addition, no reports indicate that SARS has an animal host or reservoir in the environment.   The experts confirmed that control measures, currently recommended by WHO, are supported by the available evidence on key epidemiological determinants. The maximum incubation period used for control purposes has proven effective. Participants confirmed that the overall case fatality ratio is 14% to 15% but with wide variations in case fatality related to age, sex, the presence of other diseases, and treatment protocols, and pointed to the need for more research on the significance of infection in immunocompromised persons or persons with underlying cardiorespiratory disease. The experts further supported the current WHO recommendation that persons who have an acute febrile respiratory illness should not travel.   Questions identified as requiring urgent attention include the vulnerability of children to infection, the proportion of contacts of SARS patients who develop asymptomatic infection, and the significance of contact with SARS cases in confined settings such as aircraft and hospitals.   WHO was asked to review guidelines for hospital cleaning and disinfection, to conduct case studies of individuals who appear to make a special contribution to the spread of SARS, to establish the case fatality ratio for health care workers, and to coordinate international collaborative research on SARS in pregnancy.   Participants from the main outbreak sites noted the striking similarity of the pattern of outbreaks in different countries and the consistent effectiveness of specific control measures, including early identification and isolation of patients, vigorous contact tracing, management of close contacts by home confinement or quarantine, and public information and education to encourage prompt reporting of symptoms. The effectiveness of these measures was observed in all outbreak sites under widely varying conditions, supporting the overall WHO view that SARS can be contained and driven back out of its new human host.   The outcome of the meeting will be a consensus document that will serve as both the foundation for recommended control measures and a basis for national authorities in non-affected countries to develop preparedness and management plans. Such plans help ensure that infrastructure and mechanisms are in place to prevent an outbreak should importation of a case occur.   The meeting was characterized by a spirit of frank and open exchange of data, experiences, and expert opinion. As several participants noted, global collaboration in an intense research effort is needed, as no single country can manage SARS on its own.   Travel recommendations for Hebei Province (China) WHO is today recommending that persons planning to travel to Hebei Province, China consider postponing all but essential travel. The temporary recommendation is based on the magnitude of the outbreak in Hebei, including the number of prevalent cases and the number of new cases reported daily, and evidence that local chains of transmission are occurring outside a confined setting, such as the health care environment. Together, these factors increase the risk that travellers to Hebei could become infected and subsequently export the disease elsewhere.   Similar travel advice is currently in effect for Hong Kong SAR and Taipei and for several areas of mainland China, including Beijing, Guangdong, Inner Mongolia, Shanxi, and Tianjin.   To date, Hebei has reported a cumulative total of 202 probable cases and 10 deaths.   Recommendations to international travellers are one of several measures being used by WHO to reduce opportunities for the further international spread of SARS.   Situation in Singapore The Ministry of Health in Singapore has today determined that the cluster of patients and staff in the Institute of Mental Health who developed fever on 11 to 12 May does not represent cases of SARS. None of the patients, which included 34 inpatients and 20 staff at the Institute, has shown any signs of clinical progression characteristic of SARS. Alternative diagnoses, including influenza and other causes of upper respiratory tract infection, have further excluded suspicion of SARS. Of the 54 patients, 25 have been discharged and only 7 continue to have mild febrile illness.   As a precautionary measure, the Ministry had previously decided to treat the cluster as suspect SARS cases until proven otherwise.   In line with this view, Singapore immediately introduced a series of stringent measures, including transfer of all cases to a designated hospital, active contact tracing, recall for medical consultation of all patients recently discharged from the Institute, and home quarantine for selected individuals. In addition, special accommodations for staff at the Institute, who continued to care for patients, were arranged to minimize opportunities for further transmission to occur pending results of the investigation.   The most recent probable SARS case in Singapore developed symptoms on 27 April and was isolated the following day.   Update on cases and countries As of today, a cumulative total of 7761 probable SARS cases with 623 deaths have been reported from 28 countries. This represents an increase of 33 cases and 12 deaths compared with yesterday. The new deaths occurred in China (7) and Hong Kong SAR (5).  "
"2003","http://www.who.int/csr/don/2003_05_16/en/index.html"," Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS)-multi-country outbreak - Update 57   16 May 2003 Disease Outbreak Reported  Situation in China, guidance for mass gatherings, stability of the SARS virus, more than 600 deaths globally   Situation in China China has today reported 39 new probable SARS cases and 4 new deaths, bringing the cumulative total to 5191 probable cases and 275 deaths.   Beijing reported 28 probable SARS cases today in the sixth consecutive day that the city has reported less than 50 probable SARS. From the last week of April through 3 May, Beijing was reporting a daily average of more than 100 probable cases. The daily number of new deaths has also declined from a peak of 15, reported on 22 April, to an average of 4 during the past week. Beijing reported a single death today.   WHO experts interpret the decrease in case numbers as encouraging, but have cautioned against concluding that the city’s SARS cases were on a downward trend. They warned that misdiagnosis of cases could have contributed to the lower numbers of probable cases in recent days. WHO officials fear that patients with milder symptoms of SARS are being excluded as probable cases.   The number of wrongly diagnosed patients is not known, but WHO experts became concerned that this could be happening after recent visits to Beijing hospitals.   “They fit the case definition but because they get better in a few days, they are not seen as probable cases,” explained Dr Daniel Chin, leader of WHO’s Beijing team of SARS experts. “Clinicians are making this decision because there’s an assumption that SARS patients must be very sick. But there’s a spectrum of severity for SARS.”   Clinicians were also basing their decision to exclude patients as probable SARS cases simply because they had not had any known previous contact with a SARS case – a definition used in areas with few SARS cases. Given the relatively large number of SARS cases in Beijing, such a criterion cannot be used, Dr Chin said.   He added that this was occurring due to confusion over the case definition, not because clinicians were trying to hide cases. WHO has asked the Beijing Government for a taskforce to be convened to address this issue.   Dr Chin said patients with milder SARS symptoms must be treated with all the same precautions. “It is still possible that they are not SARS cases, but without a reliable test, we can’t confirm that,” he said.   Patients with milder symptoms start off being isolated as suspect cases. But after their condition improves, they end up being sent to general medical wards, where they could infect other patients. Others may be sent home too early. “They may not need to be hospitalized but they could still be infectious,” Dr Chin said.   A study of clinical progression in 75 SARS patients, published in today’s Lancet by a Hong Kong laboratory in the WHO network, describes three clinical stages in patients from the Amoy Gardens cluster. In the mostly uniform three-stage pattern, the first week of illness was characterized by fever, myalgia, and other symptoms that generally improved after a few days. In the second week of illness, when infectivity is greatest, patients frequently experienced recurrence of fever, diarrhoea, and oxygen desaturation. In this study, 20% of the patients progressed to a third phase, characterized by acute respiratory distress syndrome necessitating ventilatory support.   Health authorities and clinicians need to be aware of these three phases of illness. In terms of preventing further spread, including nosocomial transmission, it is dangerous to prematurely relax precautions, notably isolation and infection control, following clinical improvement during the first week of illness.   Guidance for mass gatherings Guidance for mass gatherings was issued by WHO yesterday in response to concern that persons travelling to large events from areas with local transmission of SARS might pose a risk to other attendees in the host country. The recommendations, which are issued as global guidance and based on a risk-benefit analysis, are in line with WHO efforts to prevent the further international spread of SARS while also protecting the travelling public from unjustified restrictions. See Guidance for Mass Gatherings: hosting persons arriving from an area with recent local transmission of SARS   The purpose of the recommendations is to help hosting governments and organizers of such events make decisions that protect domestic populations.   Such decisions are left to the authority of individual countries based on their own assessment of the nature of the event, the potential for exposure of the general population should a case of SARS occur, and the capacity of the country’s public health infrastructure to cope. Capacity includes pre-existing arrangements for surveillance, contact tracing, and isolation – in other words, capacity for managing the situation should someone attending the event become ill with SARS.   Stability of the SARS virus in the environment WHO has today published additional data on the stability of the SARS virus on different environmental surfaces. See First data on stability and resistance of SARS coronavirus compiled by members of WHO laboratory network   The data, which come from studies conducted by laboratories in the WHO network, indicate that the SARS virus in sterilized stool can survive for 36 hours on a plastered wall or a formica surface, for 72 hours on a plastic surface or stainless steel, and for 96 hours on a glass slide.   Update on cases and countries As of today, a cumulative total of 7739 probable SARS cases and 611 deaths have been reported from 29 countries. This represents an increase of 54 new cases and 13 deaths compared with yesterday. The new deaths occurred in China (4), Hong Kong SAR (4), and Taiwan, China (5).  "

Most new cases were reported in Beijing (27), Shanxi (7), and Hebei (6). The 4 new deaths were reported in Beijing (1), Hebei (1), Inner Mongolia (1), and Tianjin (1).   The Chinese Ministry of Health is now providing the dates when the most recent probable and suspect cases were reported. New cases continue to be reported in all provinces.   The joint Ministry of Health-WHO team in Guangxi will soon complete its mission. Team members report that some probable cases may have been misclassified as suspect cases, though the number of such cases is expected to be small. Based on visits and a review of data, the team is of the view that large scale unreported transmission is not occurring in the province.   New guidelines on blood safety WHO has today issued a series of recommendations as precautionary principles to address the theoretical risk that SARS might be transmitted through the transfusion of labile blood products. WHO is stressing that the recommended measures are precautionary.   Guidance for mass gatherings WHO has today issued a series of recommendations for the organizers of mass gatherings hosting persons arriving from an area with recent local transmission of SARS.   According to current understanding of SARS, only persons with symptoms are contagious and can transmit the disease. Close contact is required for transmission.   Wearing of masks by well persons who are travelling from an area with recent local transmission of SARS is not recommended by WHO.   Update on cases and countries As of today, a cumulative total of 7699 probable cases and 598 deaths have been reported from 29 countries.

Toronto has also been removed from the list of areas for which WHO has issued recommendations pertaining to international travel.   The decision was made following a teleconference between Toronto and Health Canada officials and WHO. The teleconference, which was requested by Health Canada, reviewed the adequacy of data on the SARS situation in Canada and summarized the criteria and procedures used by WHO when making decisions about which areas should be included in the list.   The most important WHO consideration is whether 20 days have passed since the last locally acquired case was isolated or died. If no further cases have occurred for 20 days, which is twice the maximum incubation period for SARS, the chain of transmission is considered broken. The last locally acquired case in Canada was isolated on 20 April.   WHO issues recommendations related to international travel as one of several measures designed to reduce the risk of further spread of SARS.   Situation in China China has today reported 55 new probable cases of SARS and 5 new deaths, bringing the cumulative number of cases to 5124 and deaths to 267. Of the new cases, 39 were reported in Beijing.   Three new probable cases of SARS were reported today in Hebei, adjacent to Beijing municipality, bringing the cumulative total to 194 cases and 8 deaths. All three cases were previously suspect cases already in isolation. Members of a WHO team currently in Hebei report that SARS has already spread to 9 of the province’s 11 prefectures. Forty of Hebei’s SARS cases have been traced to migrant workers returning home.   Hebei has adopted a unique approach to SARS that relies on support from local communities. Physicians are working in individual townships to record all people travelling to and from areas in China with local transmission. Individuals who are found to have fevers are sent to fever clinics for further monitoring. Workers from provinces with recent local transmission are placed in observation for as long as 3 weeks, during which their temperatures are checked numerous times each day. In some cases, entire villages where cases of SARS in farmers have been detected have been placed under quarantine.   The WHO team has found that infection control measures in Hebei hospitals are scrupulously following the national guidelines, which may help explain low rate of infection in health care workers. Up to now, fewer than 10% of the province’s front-line health care staff have become infected, a figure considered by team members to be remarkably low.   Situation in Singapore Health officials reported yesterday a cluster of 24 patients and 6 nurses from the Institute of Mental Health who have recently developed fevers. All but one of the patients were from a single ward at the Institute.   In line with aggressive containment efforts in Singapore, officials decided to treat cases as though they represented a cluster of SARS cases until proven otherwise. The quick and comprehension action taken by authorities is indicative of the high level of determination to bring the outbreak to an end.   All patients and three of the nurses were transferred to Tan Tock Seng Hospital, Singapore’s designated SARS hospital, for further assessment. Two doctors who also worked in the two implicated wards have also been admitted to Tan Tock Seng Hospital for observation.   Singaporean authorities are carrying out active contact tracing. All patients discharged from the Institute of Mental Health from 23 April until 2 May are being recalled for medical consultations at Tan Tock Seng Hospital. Any patients discharged after 3 May will be quarantined at home for 10 days beginning 13 May. Close contacts of the staff and patients affected in the cluster are also being quarantined at home.   The Institute of Mental Health has adopted a series of stringent precautionary measures. These include no admission of new patients, no discharge of current inpatients, no movement of patients and staff across wards, and no referrals of inpatients to other hospitals. In addition, all outpatient, accident and emergency services are to be temporarily suspended.   The WHO team in Singapore reported today some signs that patients in the cluster, many of whom are elderly, may be ill from causes other than SARS.   No new probable cases of SARS were reported in Singapore today.   Update on cases and countries As of today, a cumulative total of 7628 probable cases and 587 deaths have been reported from 29 countries.

Cases of Cholera have been reported in Basra since 1989. In 2002, for example, 257 specimens were confirmed positive for cholera. The number of cases peaks each year during the warmest months of the year, between May and October. In recent years, diarrhoeal disease has been one of the three main killers of children in Iraq.   WHO is extremely concerned about the current high levels of diarrhoeal disease which are being reported from across Iraq. We have detailed reports of sharp increases in diarrhoeal cases from Baghdad and Mosul, as well as anecdotal reports from elsewhere. WHO believes that the lack of access to clean, safe water and the problems with security combine to produce a particularly dangerous situation in which there could be a large number of cases of diarrhoeal disease - including, but not limited to, cholera.

"2003","http://www.who.int/csr/don/2003_05_13b/en/index.html"," Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS)-multi-country outbreak - Update 54  Outbreaks in the initial “hot zones” indicate that SARS can be contained   13 May 2003 Disease Outbreak Reported   To date, the WHO approach to SARS has been aimed at sealing off opportunities for further spread, both within countries reporting cases and internationally. Experiences in a growing number of countries indicate that the disease can be contained, thus supporting WHO’s overall objective: to prevent SARS from becoming widely established as another new disease in humans.   In the absence of a vaccine, the most effective way to control a new disease such as SAS is to break the chain of transmission from infected to healthy persons. In almost all documented cases, SARS is spread through close face-to-face contact with infected droplets when a patient sneezes or coughs.   For SARS, three activities – case detection, patient isolation, and contact tracing – can reduce the number of people exposed to each infectious case and eventually break the chain of transmission.   Case detection aims to identify SARS cases as soon after onset of illness as possible. Once cases are identified, the next step is to ensure their prompt isolation, in a properly equipped facility, and management according to strict procedures of infection control. The third activity – the detective work – involves the identification of all close contacts of each case and assurance of their careful follow-up, including daily health checks and possible voluntary home isolation.   Together, these activities limit the daily number of contacts possible for each potentially infectious case. They also work to shorten the amount of time that lapses between onset of illness and isolation of the patient, thus reducing opportunities for the virus to spread to others.   The effectiveness of these measures is reflected in an important indicator of disease transmission – the so-called “effective reproduction number”. This is the average number of new cases generated by each new case.   If each new SARS patient infects more than one additional person, then the number of new cases will increase with time. If each new SARS patient infects one further person, then the number of new cases will remain static. However, if each new SARS patient infects, on average, less than one further person, then the number of new cases will fall and the outbreak will die out. This remains WHO’s overall objective, both in its support to individual countries and globally.   The example of Singapore Singapore has instituted comprehensive procedures for contact tracing and isolation, and these measures appear to be working. WHO learned yesterday, during a videoconference with Singaporean officials, that the so-called “time to isolation” had been reduced from a high of three days in the early phase of the outbreak to 1.4 days by last week, thus reducing by half the amount of time infected persons can expose others to the SARS virus.   These measures are being applied elsewhere, with SARS outbreaks coming under control in several areas. WHO is now collecting the data needed to systematically assess the effectiveness of these and other control measures being implemented around the world, and will strengthen its recommendations accordingly.   Nonetheless, as SARS has clearly demonstrated, a single case admitted to an unprepared hospital can ignite a new outbreak. While trends are moving in an encouraging direction in many areas, even greater focus on control measures is needed if SARS is to be contained globally. WHO experiences with outbreaks of Ebola haemorrhagic fever have repeatedly shown that the initial stages of containment are the most dangerous time to start lowering the level of control.   “We can’t become complacent,” says Michael J. Ryan, Coordinator of WHO’s Global Alert and Response Programme. “In fact, this is the time to intensify our efforts.”   Dr Ryan has led international field responses to large outbreaks of Ebola and several other emerging infectious diseases.   Update on cases and countries As of today, a cumulative total of 7548 probable SARS cases with 573 deaths has been reported from 29 countries. This represents an increase of 111 new cases and 21 deaths compared with yesterday. The new deaths occurred in China (10), Hong Kong SAR (7), and Taiwan, China (4).   China has reported today 80 new probable cases and 10 deaths, bringing the cumulative totals to 5086 probable cases and 262 deaths. New cases were concentrated in Beijing (48), Hebei (14), and Shanxi (13).   Taiwan reported 23 new cases and 4 deaths, bringing the cumulative totals to 207 cases and 24 deaths  "

The tests were performed by a Public Health Laboratory in Kuwait.   The risk of waterborne epidemics is very high because of the lack of safe water and poor sanitation. Experts are concerned about the spread of many other pathogens such as Shigella dysenteriae which can cause large outbreaks. Repair and maintenance of the water supply system is ongoing and security is being upgraded to protect these facilities. Dissemination of health education messages in communities is also essential to control the outbreak.   WHO does not recommend any restrictions on travel or trade to be taken against Iraq. As the outbreak is related to the lack of access to safe water, neighbouring countries which are not facing the same difficulties should not be affected.  "
"2003","http://www.who.int/csr/don/2003_05_12/en/index.html"," Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS)-multi-country outbreak - Update 53  Situation in Singapore and Hong Kong, interpretation of “areas with recent local transmission”   12 May 2003 Disease Outbreak Reported   Situation in Singapore A panel of WHO experts conferred by videoconference today with Singaporean officials, led by Minister for Health and Second Minister for Finance Lim Hng Kiang and Minister of State for Health Dr Balaji Sadasivan, to assess progress in containing the SARS outbreak.   Singapore has greatly increased its containment measures aimed at halting further transmission of SARS. A special effort has been made to raise the standards of infection control at Tan Tock Seng Hospital, which was converted into the country’s specialized hospital for managing SARS patients.   Singapore has also introduced strict screening measures for all outbound air passengers. Selected incoming passengers from areas with recent local transmission of SARS are also screened. Nineteen thermal infrared scanners are in place at the airport, on loan from the military. The machines are capable of detecting a fever within a 0.2°C degree range of accuracy.   Next week, 7 more scanners are expected to be added, ensuring that all inbound and outbound passengers can be checked. Last week, of the 70,000 passengers that were screened, 58 were found to have fever and taken to the SARS-designated hospital. Two were later admitted as suspect SARS cases, but neither has been reclassified as probable. All contacts of known SARS cases are being placed under supervised home quarantine for 10 days.   Singapore’s actions to contain the SARS outbreak were described as “exemplary” by Dr David Heymann, Executive Director of communicable disease programmes at WHO. “Singapore has been one of the most successful countries in its response to SARS,” said Dr Heymann.   Situation in Hong Kong Hong Kong today reported 5 new probable cases of SARS. The territory has seen a steady decline in the number of new cases, which has been in the single digits for the past eight days. WHO experts also held a videoconference with Hong Kong’s Secretary of Health, Welfare and Food, Dr Eng-kiong Yeoh and Director of Health Dr Margaret Chan today. WHO commended Hong Kong officials for their level of transparency in reporting on the SARS situation in the territory, a degree of cooperation that would be valuable from all countries.   Hong Kong has introduced a rigorous contact tracing procedure. All close contacts of known SARS cases are quarantined at home. In addition, their Hong Kong Identity Card numbers are passed to the Immigration Department to ensure that these individuals cannot leave the territory.   Contact tracing has established epidemiological links for the majority of Hong Kong’s SARS patients. Around 8.6% of patients have no identifiable exposure source. Detailed investigation is ongoing.   The last known exportation of a SARS case from Hong Kong occurred on 18 April.   Interpretation of “areas with recent local transmission” The list of areas with recent local transmission is issued by WHO to facilitate use of the SARS case definition to detect and report suspect and probable cases. A recent history of travel to an area where local transmission outside a confined setting, such as the health care environment, has been documented can assist physicians in the interpretation of symptoms in international travellers.   Inclusion of countries and areas in this list, which is stratified, does not mean that WHO recommends travel restrictions to the country or area.   Beginning today, WHO is posting on its website a new table indicating those areas with recent local transmission for which WHO has issued recommendations pertaining to international travel. Two recommended measures are specified: exit screening for international travellers departing the area, and traveller to consider postponing all but essential travel to the area. The table will be updated daily.   No travel restrictions are recommended by WHO to any other areas.   The previous list of “areas with recent local transmission” continues to be issued daily, but is now linked to the SARS case definitions. This change is introduced to reduce opportunities for misinterpretation of the purpose and significance of the list.   Update on cases and countries As of today, a cumulative total of 7447 probable cases with 552 deaths have been reported from 30 countries. This represents an increase of 168 new cases and 26 deaths since the last update was issued on Saturday. The new deaths were reported in China (17), Hong Kong SAR (6), Taiwan, China (2), and Singapore (1).   China has today reported 144 new probable cases, bringing the cumulative total to 5013 cases, with 252 deaths. Most new cases were reported in Beijing (48) and Hebei (11).   Taiwan reported 12 new cases, bringing the cumulative total to 184 cases, with 20 deaths.  "
"2003","http://www.who.int/csr/don/2003_05_10/en/index.html"," Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS)-multi-country outbreak - Update 52  Situation in China, the Philippines, and Mongolia   10 May 2003 Disease Outbreak Reported   Situation in China China has reported 85 new probable cases of SARS today, including 54 new cases in Beijing, and 5 new deaths. China now has a cumulative total of 4884 probable cases, with 235 deaths.   Beijing remains the most severely affected area in mainland China, with a cumulative total of 2227 probable cases and 116 deaths. Since the beginning of this month, Beijing has reported 862 new probable cases and 41 deaths. The largest number of cases for this month occurred on 1 May, when Beijing reported 122 new cases and 7 deaths.   Although today’s figures are lower, WHO officials in Beijing have cautioned against any clear conclusions that the SARS outbreak has begun to decline in the city. Many factors that influence the outbreak’s future evolution remain unknown. For example, half of all new probable cases in the city do not have any recorded previous contact with a SARS patient. Knowledge about the source of transmission for all SARS cases contributes to understanding of the dynamics of the outbreak and assists in its containment.   WHO officials will be working with Beijing authorities to improve data analysis and develop policy options for responding to the outbreak. The lack of known contact to a SARS patient among the more recently reported cases could be related to either how cases are being reported or how and where the virus is being transmitted.   Situation in the Philippines As of 10 May, the Philippines has reported a cumulative total of 10 probable SARS cases, with two deaths. Health authorities have determined that all 10 cases are part of a chain of transmission linked to a single imported case. All cases were placed in isolation in hospital.   Contacts of the 10 cases have been traced, and authorities are confident that all contacts have been identified and placed in isolation. The last two cases that could have transmitted infection were isolated on 30 April. All contacts have completed their period of observation and none has developed SARS.   The cluster of SARS cases in the Philippines began with the importation of a case who returned to the Philippines from Toronto, Canada. The imported case subsequently died from SARS, as did her father. Two of the remaining eight patients have been discharged. The others are recovering in hospital.   WHO considers that the cluster of SARS cases has been well contained. There appears to be no increased transmission risk in the Philippines. For these reasons, WHO does not recommend any restrictions on travel to the Philippines.   Situation in Mongolia Yesterday Mongolia was removed from the list of countries with recent local transmission. Twenty days had passed since the only case resulting from local transmission was appropriately isolated.   Earlier, WHO sent specialists to the country to investigate the cluster of cases and provide technical support. Isolation facilities were judged adequate and contact tracing was considered complete. WHO has therefore concluded that the cluster of cases in Mongolia has been well contained.   The cumulative total of probable SARS cases in Mongolia is nine. No deaths have occurred. Six of the nine cases have recovered. The additional three cases remain in isolation in a SARS-designated hospital.   WHO does not recommend any restrictions on travel to Mongolia.   Update on cases and countries As of today, a cumulative total of 7296 probable SARS cases with 526 deaths have been reported from 30 countries. This represents an increase of 119 cases and 12 deaths when compared with yesterday.   Most of the new cases were reported in China (85) and Taiwan, China (23). The new deaths occurred in China (8), Hong Kong SAR (2), and Taiwan, China (5).  "

He will be meeting with Vice Premier Wu Yi and other officials in the ministries of health and foreign affairs. The purpose of the visit is to exchange views on the SARS situation and other health issues in China.   Dr Lee, who was nominated in January for the post of WHO Director-General, currently directs the WHO’s Stop TB initiative. He has worked at WHO for 19 years in technical, managerial and policy positions. Prior to heading the TB initiative, he led the WHO effort to reduce childhood deaths from vaccine-preventable diseases.   During his tenure in WHO’s Western Pacific Regional Office, Dr Lee visited China many times, particularly in conjunction with the region’s successful effort to eradicate poliomyelitis.   If confirmed by the World Health Assembly, which convenes later this month, Dr Lee will succeed Dr Gro Harlem Brundtland and begin his five-year term in July 2003.   China has today reported 118 new probable SARS cases and 6 new deaths, bringing the cumulative totals to 4805 probable cases and 230 deaths.   Today, Being reported 48 new cases and 2 new deaths, Inner Mongolia reported 20 new cases and 1 new death, Shanxi reported 11 new cases, and Hebei reported 9 new cases and 2 deaths. The additional death was reported in Tianjin.   Yesterday, a WHO team travelled to Hebei Province, which borders Beijing municipality, to assess the SARS situation. The WHO investigation is being conducted in collaboration with the Ministry of Health and marks the first time that a joint WHO-Ministry of Health team has been sent to a province. WHO has expressed concern that Hebei could be particularly vulnerable to the spread of SARS, as the province has a large population of migrant workers – part of Beijing’s “floating population”.   The investigation in Hebei has two objectives: to review the surveillance and case reporting systems, and to visit hospitals to asses procedures for patient management and infection control. In several outbreaks elsewhere, lapses in infection control have resulted in the infection of large number of hospital staff.   More than 7000 cases and 500 deaths reported globally As of today, a cumulative total of 7183 probable cases of SARS and 514 deaths have been reported from 30 countries on six continents. This represents an increase of 144 new cases and 8 deaths when compared with yesterday. Of the new deaths, 6 were reported in China, and 2 were reported in Hong Kong SAR.   In the past week, more than 1000 new probable cases and 96 deaths were reported globally.  "

This temporary advice will be reassessed regularly.   Following global alerts about cases of SARS, issued by WHO on 12 and 15 March, national authorities have heightened surveillance for suspect and probable cases. In many countries, prompt detection and isolation of initial cases have prevented further transmission altogether or held additional cases to a very small number.   On 27 March, WHO recommended additional measures aimed at preventing the travel-related spread of SARS. These recommended measures, which include the screening of air passengers departing from areas with recent local transmission of SARS, continue to apply.   Information about the magnitude of the SARS outbreaks in Tianjin and Inner Mongolia provinces of China, and Taipei in Taiwan province of China, has been carefully reviewed by WHO. The travel advice is based on a consideration of the magnitude of the outbreaks in these regions, including both the number of prevalent cases and the daily number of new cases. The extent of local chains of transmission as well as the potential for spread beyond these areas were also major factors in the reasoning for this advice.   WHO travel advice is issued to protect international public health and to reduce opportunities for further global spread. SARS is a new disease, first recognized in late February, that has spread along the routes of international air travel. As of 7 May, a cumulative total of 6903 cases had been reported from 29 countries on five continents. Precautionary measures aim to reduce the impact of SARS and contain the disease while it is still in a relatively early stage.   The SARS situation is assessed on a regular basis to determine whether the status of areas listed for travel advice needs to be modified, whether other areas need to be added, and if additional precautionary measures are required.   Current travel advice, whereby WHO recommends that people consider postponing all but essential travel, are now in effect for several areas of China, namely: Beijing, Hong Kong, Guangdong, Inner Mongolia, Shanxi, Taipei and Tianjin.   More information about SARS, including the cumulative number of cases, guidelines and scientific findings are updated regularly on the WHO website: www.who.int/csr/sars.  "
"2003","http://www.who.int/csr/don/2003_05_07a/en/index.html"," Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS)-multi-country outbreak - Update 49   7 May 2003   Disease Outbreak Reported  SARS case fatality ratio, incubation period   Case fatality ratio WHO has today revised its initial estimates of the case fatality ratio of SARS. The revision is based on an analysis of the latest data from Canada, China, Hong Kong SAR, Singapore, and Viet Nam.   On the basis of more detailed and complete data, and more reliable methods, WHO now estimates that the case fatality ratio of SARS ranges from 0% to 50% depending on the age group affected, with an overall estimate of case fatality of 14% to 15%.   The likelihood of dying from SARS in a given area has been shown to depend on the profile of the cases, including the age group most affected and the presence of underlying disease. Based on data received by WHO to date, the case fatality ratio is estimated to be less than 1% in persons aged 24 years or younger, 6% in persons aged 25 to 44 years, 15% in persons aged 45 to 64 years, and greater than 50% in persons aged 65 years and older.   A case fatality ratio measures the proportion of all people with a disease who will die from the disease. In other words, it measures the likelihood that a disease will kill its host, and is thus an important indicator of the severity of a disease and its significance as a public health problem. The likelihood that a person will die of SARS could be influenced by factors related to the SARS virus, the route of exposure and dose (amount) of virus, personal factors such as age or the presence of another disease, and access to prompt medical care.   Many factors complicate efforts to calculate a case fatality ratio while an outbreak is still evolving. Deaths from SARS typically occur after several weeks of illness. Full recovery may take even longer. While an epidemic is still evolving, only some of the individuals affected by the disease will have died or recovered. Only at the end of an epidemic can an absolute value be calculated, taking into account total deaths, total recoveries and people lost to follow-up. Calculating case fatality as the number of deaths reported divided by the number of cases reported irrespective of the time elapsed since they became ill gives an underestimate of the true case fatality ratio.   One method of overcoming this difficulty is to calculate the case fatality ratio using only those cases whose final outcome – died or recovered – is known. However, this method, when applied before an outbreak is over, gives an overestimate because the average time from illness onset to death for SARS is shorter than the average time from illness onset to recovery.   With these methods, estimates of the case fatality ratio range from 11% to 17% in Hong Kong, from 13% to 15% in Singapore, from 15% to 19% in Canada, and from 5% to 13% in China.   A more accurate and unbiased estimation of case fatality for SARS can be obtained with a third method, survival analysis. This method relies on detailed individual data on the time from illness onset to death or full recovery, or time since illness onset for current cases. Using this method, WHO estimates that the case fatality ratio is 14% in Singapore and 15% in Hong Kong.   In Viet Nam, where SARS has been contained and measurement is more straightforward, case fatality was comparatively low, at 8%. One explanation for this is the large number of total cases that occurred in younger, previously healthy health care workers.   Incubation period WHO has also reviewed estimates of the incubation period of SARS, using individual case data. On the basis of this review, WHO continues to conclude that the current best estimate of the maximum incubation period is 10 days.   The incubation period, which is the time from exposure to a causative agent to onset of disease, is particularly important as it forms the basis for many recommended control measures, including contact tracing and the duration of home isolation for contacts of probable SARS cases. Knowledge about the incubation period can also help physicians make diagnostic decisions about whether the presenting symptoms and clinical history of a patient point to SARS or to some other disease.   The incubation period can vary from one case to another according to the route by which the person was exposed, the dose of virus received, and other factors, including immune status. Estimates of the incubation period are further complicated by the fact that some patients have had opportunities for multiple exposures to the virus. The particular exposure that caused disease may prove impossible to determine. For these reasons, the most reliable estimates of the incubation period are based on a study of cases having a single documented exposure to a known case.   In today’s review, WHO has analysed the incubation periods of individuals with well-defined single-point exposures in Singapore, Canada, and Europe. Findings support the original estimate of 10 days as the maximum incubation period.   However, one recently published analysis of data from Hong Kong estimates a longer maximum incubation period in a group of 57 patients. This analysis, which may be significant and important for disease control, will be studied in more detail. The longer incubation period could reflect differences in methodology, specificity of diagnosis, route of transmission, infectious dose, or other factors. Reliable diagnosis – determining that all cases diagnosed as SARS are true cases of the disease – has been particularly difficult to establish in this outbreak, as diagnosis is made based on a set of non-specific symptoms and clinical signs that are seen in several other diseases.   Prompt isolation WHO continues to recommend the earliest possible isolation of all suspect and probable cases of SARS. A short time between onset of symptoms and isolation reduces opportunities for transmission to others. It also reduces the number of contacts requiring active follow-up, and thus helps relieve some of the burden on health services. In addition, prompt hospitalization gives patients the best chance of receiving possibly life-saving care should their condition take a critical course.   Update on cases and countries As of today, a cumulative total of 6903 probable SARS cases and 495 deaths has been reported from 29 countries. This represents an increase of 186 new cases and 17 deaths compared with yesterday. The new deaths occurred in China (5), Hong Kong SAR (11) and Taiwan (1).  "

"2003","http://www.who.int/csr/don/2003_05_06/en/index.html"," Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS)-multi-country outbreak - Update 48   6 May 2003 Disease Outbreak Reported A panel of WHO staff participated in a video teleconference with Hong Kong government officials earlier today to discuss the SARS situation in Hong Kong. Present at the meeting from Hong Kong were the Secretary for Health, Welfare and Food, Dr. Eng-kiong Yeoh, Director of Health, Dr. Margaret Chan, and the Health, Welfare and Food Bureau’s Head of Research, Dr. Lo Su Vui. WHO staff included Dr David Heymann, Executive Director for Communicable Diseases, and a panel with expertise in virology, epidemiology, and clinical medicine.   Following a presentation by Dr Yeoh, Dr Heymann characterized the efforts taken in Hong Kong to stem the spread of SARS as “heroic.” “All of us have nothing but admiration for you and your team,” he added.   Particularly impressive among the measures, which is some cases exceed those recommended by WHO, are exit screening procedures at border checkpoints, publication of information on all buildings where residents have developed SARS, procedures for isolation and quarantine, and aggressive contract tracing that relies on a system initially developed by the police force for use in criminal investigations.   Hong Kong reported 9 new SARS cases today, including 2 health care workers and 7 contacts of patients known to have had SARS. To date, Hong Kong has reported a cumulative total of 1646 probable cases and 193 deaths.   The number of new cases (in the single digits for the last several days) has steadily declined, suggesting that the outbreak has peaked. Epidemiological data submitted to WHO today indicate three apparent peaks of SARS in Hong Kong: the Prince of Wales Hospital outbreak (18 March), the Amoy Gardens outbreak (30 March), and a smaller outbreak in the outlying region of Tai Po (11 April).   Since 29 March, Hong Kong has introduced medical posts, supported by infrared temperature scanners, at its border points. All incoming travellers are now required to sign health declarations. As of 14 April, the government has prohibited close contacts of SARS patients from leaving Hong Kong, by monitoring residents via their Hong Kong Identity Card numbers. As a result of these routine checks, 37 people have been referred to health authorities. Of these, two were later confirmed to be SARS cases.   Hong Kong is also employing a strategic computer system to facilitate contact tracing and to identify addresses and names of close contacts of SARS patients. Geographic clusters of SARS cases, or so-called “hot spots” in certain buildings throughout the territory have been identified using this scheme. The government maintains data on cases and their contacts in a centralized, dedicated eSARS database.   Dr Yeoh also announced today that no new cases associated with the Amoy Gardens outbreak have occurred for 20 days. Hong Kong has recently launched several public information and education campaigns to increase SARS awareness. These efforts have been successful in encouraging people experiencing symptoms to seek prompt medical care, thus reducing the time when people capable of spreading the virus are circulating in the community.   China China reported 138 new probable SARS cases today, 70 of which were from Beijing, bringing the cumulative total in the country and capital to 4409 and 1960 respectively. There were also 8 deaths reported, half from Beijing, bringing the total number of SARS deaths to 214.   New probable SARS cases were also reported in Guangdong (12), Hebei (6), Inner Mongolia (21), Jilin (2) and Tianjin (11). The number of cases in Jilin has increased in the last few days, with cases tripling tos 23 since April 30. There were also two new cases in Shanghai, bringing the city’s total number of cases to six.   Cases continued to rise in the two most heavily affected provinces outside of the capital, Shanxi and Inner Mongolia, with 11 and 21 probable cases reported, for a total of 369 and 251 respectively.   WHO experts will visit Hebei province in China as part of a joint Ministry of Health-WHO team to assess the SARS situation and the capacity to cope with an outbreak.   Four WHO experts will leave on 8 May with experts from China’s Ministry of Health for the province, which surrounds Beijing and is home to some of the capital’s “floating population” of migrant workers.   The number of probable SARS cases in Hebei has risen sharply in the last few days to a total of 113, as of today. In just five days between April 30 and May 4, the numbers doubled to 98. There are also about 100 suspect SARS cases in the province.   “We feel the team can make a difference here. It’s still early on in the epidemic. Our input at this stage could prevent the situation developing into a large outbreak. The level of development in the province is also above average, so any recommendations made can be quickly implemented, although resources will still be stretched,” said Alan Schnur, from WHO’s China office who will join the team.   “There’s a lot of movement between the province and the capital so we are concerned about the potential for the disease to spread,” he added.   Update on cases and countries As of today, a cumulative total of 6727 probable SARS cases with 478 deaths have been reported from 29 countries. This represents an increase of 153 new cases and 17 new deaths compared with yesterday.   Colombia reported its first probable case today. India also reported a probable case today.   "
"2003","http://www.who.int/csr/don/2003_05_05/en/index.html"," Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS)-multi-country outbreak - Update 47  Studies of SARS virus survival, situation in China   5 May 2003 Disease Outbreak Reported   Scientists in the WHO network of collaborating laboratories yesterday reported results of the first scientific studies designed to determine the survival time of the SARS virus in different environmental media. Results from studies of the effectiveness of different disinfectants commonly used in hospitals were also reported, confirming the validity of currently recommended measures for infection control.   The new studies, conducted at network labs in Hong Kong, Japan, and Germany confirm, as anticipated, that the SARS virus can survive after drying on plastic surfaces for up to 48 hours. Ongoing studies are testing virus stability on additional surfaces, with initial results expected by Wednesday.   Scientists have also tested virus survival times in faeces. Research conducted at one Hong Kong lab determined that the virus can survive in faeces for at least 2 days, and in urine for at least 24 hours. Studies conducted at a second Hong Kong lab found that virus in faeces taken from patients suffering from diarrhoea, which has a lower acidity than normal stools, could survive for 4 days. This raises the possibility that surfaces contaminated with faeces from patients suffering from diarrhoea might survive for as long as 4 days. However, the dose of virus needed to cause infection remains unknown. Further studies are needed before firm conclusions about the role of faecal-oral transmission can be made.   Results of the new studies underscore the need for frequent handwashing, proper cleaning, and good disinfection control in hospitals managing SARS cases. Spread by infected droplets remains the most important mode of transmission. Good personal hygiene, including frequent handwashing, is important for everyone in areas with SARS cases, but most especially so for persons who have been in close contact with a probable case.   Shedding of the SARS virus in faeces, respiratory secretions, and urine is now well-established. In Hong Kong in late March, a large and sudden cluster of more than 320 simultaneous cases occurred among residents of the Amoy Gardens housing estate. The outbreak raised the possibility of an environmental source of infection. Subsequent investigations suggested that contamination with sewage might have played a role. Around 66% of Amoy Gardens SARS patients presented with diarrhoea as a symptom, compared with 2% to 7% of cases in other outbreaks. With the exception of the Amoy Gardens cluster and a previous event where cases were linked to visits to a single floor of a hotel, SARS is thought to spread in the majority of cases through close person-to-person exposure to infected droplets expelled during coughing or sneezing.   All previous speculation about the environmental behaviour of the SARS virus was based on knowledge about other well-known human members of the Coronavirus family, which cause illnesses such as the common cold. WHO has been concerned that the SARS virus, which is unlike any other human or animal virus in its family, might behave differently. Studies now under way in the network laboratories will support the further development and implementation of virus-specific infection control measures. WHO remains concerned that the SARS virus continues to be transmitted to hospital staff in highly advanced settings where sophisticated infection control measures are in place.   Situation in China Chinese authorities reported 160 new probable cases of SARS and 9 new deaths. The new figures bring the cumulative total in China to 4280 probable cases and 206 deaths. Of the new cases, 98 were reported in Beijing. The second highest number of new cases was reported in Shanxi. Three of the 9 deaths occurred in Beijing, 3 in Guangdong, 2 in Shanxi, and 1 in Tianjin.   The new figures bring the cumulative total in China to 4280 probable cases and 206 deaths. China now accounts for 65% of the world’s total cumulative number of probable SARS cases and 44% of all reported deaths.   In Beijing, some 16,000 residents remain under quarantine. In Taiyuan, the capital of Shanxi Province, where 360 probable SARS cases have been reported, all schools are to be closed indefinitely.   WHO officials are particularly concerned about the SARS situation in China’s outer provinces, where surveillance and reporting systems may not be sufficiently sensitive to detect all suspect and probable cases. In resource-poor regions like Gansu and Jiangxi, serious questions remain about the capacity of the health systems to cope with a challenge on the scale of SARS.   Update on cases and countries As of today, a cumulative total of 6583 probable SARS cases with 461 deaths have been reported from 27 countries. This represents an increase of 364 new cases and 26 new deaths since the last report was compiled on Saturday.  "
"2003","http://www.who.int/csr/don/2003_05_03/en/index.html"," Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS)-multi-country outbreak - Update 46  WHO sends team to Taiwan, situation in China   3 May 2003 Disease Outbreak Reported WHO sends team to Taiwan The spread of SARS in Taiwan has accelerated considerably during the past week. Yesterday, Taiwan announced a cumulative total of 100 probable SARS cases, a number representing almost a tripling of cases over the past 10 days. Since the outbreak began, 8 deaths have occurred.   A WHO team arrived today in Taipei to support health authorities in combating the SARS outbreak. The two-person team, with expertise in epidemiology and virology, will visit hospitals and consult with local health authorities. As the outbreak has affected a number of hospital staff, a principal focus with be on the possible need to strengthen infection control procedures. The WHO team will also advise Taiwan officials on how best to stop the spread of the virus on the island.   Taiwan’s Center for Disease Control reported the first two suspected SARS cases, in a couple, on 14 March. The man had a February travel history to Guangdong Province and Hong Kong SAR. On 26 March, a Taiwanese resident of Hong Kong’s Amoy Gardens flew to Taiwan and took a train to Taichung to celebrate the traditional festival, Qing Ming. The man’s brother became Taiwan’s first SARS fatality, and a fellow passenger on the train also became a case. By 16 April, 27 probable cases had been detected in Taiwan. Investigation of cases determined that all either had a travel history to an affected area, or had been in close contact with patients.   The number of cases began increasingly steadily in the last weeks of April. Several staff at two hospitals have become infected. On 28 April, the Taiwanese government imposed a mandatory 14-day quarantine on all incoming travellers from China, Hong Kong, Singapore, Macau and Toronto, Canada.   Situation in China China reported 181 new probable SARS cases today, 114 of which were from Beijing, bringing the cumulative total in the country and capital to 3971 and 1741 respectively. There were also 9 deaths reported, five of which were from Beijing.   New probable SARS cases were also reported in Shanxi (18), Tianjin (18), Inner Mongolia (10), Hebei (9), Guangdong (11) and Ningxia (1). Ten of the new cases in Tianjin were among health care workers.   Nearly 20% of cases in Beijing have occurred among health care workers in hospitals. Among the 114 new probable cases reported today in Beijing, 20 were among health care workers. These figures underscore the importance of rigorous infection control in hospitals and the need to strengthen measures in place in Beijing.   As of this morning, 13,688 people in the capital were in quarantine. Among buildings quarantined are 27 SARS-designated hospitals, two building sites and three apartment buildings belonging to universities.   Under on cases and countries As of today, a cumulative total of 6234 probable cases with 435 deaths have been reported from 27 countries. This represents an increase of 191 new cases and 18 deaths compared with yesterday. The new deaths occurred in China (9) and Hong Kong SAR (9).  "

These numbers bring the cumulative total in China to 3799 and 1636 in the capital. Eleven deaths were reported, accounting for a cumulative total of 181 deaths.   Inner Mongolia reported a jump of 26 in probable SARS cases, for a total of 180 cases in that province. Other provinces reporting new cases include Hebei (14), Guangdong (9), Jilin (5) and Shanxi (4).   A WHO field visit to one large hospital not officially designated as a SARS hospital demonstrated the urgent need to review strategies for infection control procedures. Current infection control practices in emergency rooms may need to be modified, since health care workers continue to be infected. Among front-line health workers, 15 new cases were reported in Beijing. There are now 300 infected health care workers. 9 more cases among health workers were also reported in Tianjin.   WHO team members in Beijing continue working with officials from the city’s municipal health authorities to analyze epidemiological trends, but much missing data remain to be collected, and reports from case investigations must still be completed. “The public needs to have more information on when and where infection is happening,” said Dr Henk Bekedam, WHO’s representative in China. “We don’t know that right now.”   Update on cases and countries As of today, a cumulative total of 6054 probable SARS cases with 417 deaths have been reported from 27 countries. This represents an increase of 207 new cases and 26 deaths when compared with yesterday. The new deaths were reported in Canada (2), China (11), Hong Kong SAR (8), and Taiwan (5).   Taiwan, which has a rapidly evolving outbreak, reported today a cumulative total of 100 probable cases, with 11 new cases compared with yesterday. Eight SARS deaths have occurred in Taiwan. Canada reported 2 new probable cases today.   Areas with recent local transmission As of today, WHO is now issuing daily lists of countries having areas where local transmission has occurred within the past 20 days. Local transmission occurs when one or more probable cases of SARS most likely acquired their infection locally, regardless of the setting, as opposed to cases in which infection was acquired in another country. The new list, which replaces the previous list of affected areas, also stratifies the extent of local transmission into low, medium, and high categories.  "

"2003","http://www.who.int/csr/don/2003_05_01/en/index.html"," Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) - Multi-country outbreak - Update 44   1 May 2003 Disease Outbreak Reported  Situation in China, revised case definition, support to national labs   Situation in China The number of new SARS cases continues to increase steadily in China, particularly in Beijing. Today, China reported 187 new cases and 11 deaths, more than half of which were in the capital.   WHO officials in China believe the development of a central database of operational SARS data would greatly aid in combating the disease. The next few months will prove crucial in the attempt to contain SARS worldwide, which now greatly depends on whether the disease can be controlled in China.   WHO is studying how best to support hospitals in some of China’s poorer western and northern provinces. Concern continues that hospitals in these resource-poor regions may not have the necessary facilities to properly isolate and treat SARS patients. More front-line hospital staff with expertise in dealing with infectious diseases may be required. Guidelines are also needed for China’s national health care system on the kinds of infection control measures needed to prevent continuing transmission of the disease.   Shanghai is to enforce stricter SARS preventive measures, including the enforcement of 14-day quarantine periods for travelers arriving from affected areas. These measures are even stricter than those currently recommended by WHO.  Traffic checkpoints have already been set up to screen people coming into the city, where they are given temperature checks and asked to fill out health declaration forms.   WHO revises SARS case definition WHO has today updated its case definition for SARS to take into account the appropriate use of results from laboratory tests. Several diagnostic tests have been developed by various laboratories for the detection of the SARS virus and antibodies to the virus. However, all presently available tests have specific strengths and weaknesses.   For this reason, WHO continues to advise clinicians that patients should not have their case definition category downgraded while awaiting results of laboratory testing or on the basis of negative results.   WHO is concerned that inappropriate use of laboratory results can have a negative impact on patient management and selection of an appropriate level of infection control. Therefore, negative test results for the SARS virus cannot be used to exclude infection in either suspect or probable cases. In contrast, positive results of quality-assured laboratory testing can add to the efficacy of SARS case management, provided tests are properly conducted and interpreted.   Positive virus results from lab tests demonstrate that the patient is excreting virus, or its genetic material, and thus might pose a risk of disease transmission to others. Consequently, suspect SARS cases with a positive lab result (virus isolation or PCR) should be classified and reported as probable cases.   Guidance for quality assurance, particularly for PCR tests, has been posted at the WHO website. See Recommendations for laboratories testing by PCR for presence of SARS coronavirus -RNA   WHO supports calibration of diagnostic tests WHO, supported by members of its laboratory network for SARS diagnosis and the Robert-Koch Institute, Germany, is making standardized reagents available to improve reliability and support the quality assurance of diagnostic tests for SARS. Virological standards are being made available to ministries of health in countries with SARS outbreaks immediately, with shipment scheduled to begin on Monday 5 May. Serological kits will be made available by 12 May.   Ministries of health are invited to designate national laboratories and communicate their needs to WHO at sars virus@who.int or fax 0041 22 791 48 78.   The diagnostic standards will be made available to up to 3 laboratories in all countries. In China, however, the supply will be sufficient for all major laboratories in all provinces.   WHO is now planning an external proficiency testing programme to assess the performance of diagnostic tests and establish the basis for quality control.   Update on cases and countries As of today, a cumulative total of 5865 probable cases with 391 deaths have been reported from 27 countries. This represents an increase of 212 additional cases and 19 deaths when compared with yesterday. The deaths occurred in China (11), Hong Kong (5), Taiwan (2), and Singapore (1). Poland reported its first case today.   The United Kingdom and the United States of America have been removed from the list of areas with recent local transmission. In both countries, the last instance of local transmission occurred more than 20 days ago. Tianjin, China and Ulaanbaatar City, Mongolia, were added to the list.  "

China now accounts for more probable cases than the rest of the world combined.   Beijing reported the highest number of new cases (101) and deaths (9), for a cumulative total of 1440 probable cases and 75 deaths. Of these new cases, 31 were previously reported as suspect cases while 70 were reported for the first time.   Nine hospitals in the Chinese capital now deal exclusively with SARS patients. Just outside Beijing, a 1000-bed complex has been built to accommodate incoming patients. Health authorities have expressed concern that the SARS outbreak could overwhelm Beijing’s already crowded hospitals.   Xiong Ke Chest Hospital will open a new wing with 100 more beds for SARS patients tomorrow, hospital officials told a WHO expert during a visit to the hospital today. With 235 beds all occupied by SARS patients, the hospital already has the largest number of SARS patients in the country.   Dr James Maguire, from the WHO team of experts, said that despite extremely difficult working conditions, hospital staff had risen to the occasion. “Their esprit de corps is excellent. They are taking great pride in what they are doing and working very hard,” he said, adding that some staff work 45 days without seeing their families. The rigorous infection control procedures included heavy and hot protective clothing.   Dr Maguire, an epidemiologist with the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta, Georgia, said there was a need for more specialized equipment such as masks, gloves, ventilatory equipment, layer protective gear, and ambulances to transport patients between hospitals. WHO staff are aware that other hospitals in the city may need more or better supplies.   The disease continued to make its mark elsewhere in the country. Jiangsu Province, which borders Shanghai, reported its first case today. More cases were reported in western China, with 34 more probable cases from Shanxi and seven more from Inner Mongolia, giving a total of 299 and 127 probable cases respectively. One fifth of the cases (65) in Shanxi Province are among health workers.   Hebei also continued to report more cases, with nine more probable cases, giving a total of 48. Tianjin reported five more probable cases for a total of 49 cases, while Guangdong reported six, for a total of 1405.   Update on countries and cases As of today, a cumulative total of 5663 probable cases with 372 deaths have been reported from 26 countries. This represents an increase of 211 new cases and 19 deaths when compared with yesterday. The new deaths were reported in China (11), Hong Kong SAR (7), and China, Taiwan (1). This was the first death in Taiwan, where the number of probable SARS cases has more than doubled, from 37 to 78, over the past week. China, Macao SAR reported its first probable case today.  "

Travel advisories for Beijing, Hong Kong SAR, and Guangdong and Shanxi provinces, China, remain in effect.   Travel advisories are issued following consideration of several factors, including the magnitude of probable SARS cases, the last dates of cases of community transmission, and the last dates of export of cases.   Dr Brundtland cited three changes in Toronto over the last week. The magnitude of probable SARS cases has decreased. Twenty days have passed since the last cases of community transmission occurred. No new confirmed exportation of cases has occurred.   WHO has also been assured by Canadian authorities that pro-active screening measures at airports will be implemented, as recommended by WHO.   There is no change in Toronto’s status as an “affected area.” Viet Nam, which is the first country to have contained its SARS outbreak, was removed from the list of affected areas yesterday.   SARS is the first major new infectious disease of the 21st century and is taking full advantage of the opportunities for rapid international spread afforded by a closely interconnected and highly mobile society. The purpose of travel advisories is to reduce opportunities for further international spread of what is a new, severe, and poorly understood infectious disease.   Travel advisories are reviewed daily. Advice is issued on the basis of a set of epidemiological criteria. The risk to international public health, which is the principal concern for WHO, occurs when the magnitude and dynamics of an outbreak allow an infected person to slip past control measures and undertake international travel, possibly seeding an outbreak elsewhere.   Situation in China A total of 202 new probable SARS cases were reported across China today, bringing the total number of cases in the country to 3303. Nine deaths were also reported today.   Probable SARS cases have now been reported from 21 of China’s 31 provinces. An additional four provinces have reported suspected cases.   Beijing continues to report a high number of SARS cases, with 152 new probable cases and 9 deaths reported today. China’s capital city now has a cumulative total of 1347 probable cases and 59 deaths.   China’s largest number of cumulative cases remains concentrated in Guangdong Province, where the SARS outbreak began in mid-November. Only 10% of these cases are current. As 1201 patients have been discharged and 51 have died, there are less than 150 SARS cases remaining in Guangdong’s health care system.   In contrast, the rapidly growing number of new cases in Beijing imposes a heavy burden on the health care system and particularly its hospital capacity. In Beijing, 86% of cases (1198 cases) are current.   The situation in western China continues to be of concern. New probable cases in Shanxi (23) and Inner Mongolia (7) increase the cumulative totals to 266 and 120 respectively.   WHO is working with local health authorities in Beijing to review and improve the data needed to better monitor the SARS situation and assess the success of current control strategies. The WHO team of experts also visited hospitals which will soon be opened as SARS referral hospitals to assess their level of preparedness.   Update on cases and countries As of today, a cumulative total of 5462 probable cases with 353 deaths have been reported from 27 countries. This represents an increase of 226 new cases and 24 deaths when compared with yesterday.   Of the 226 new cases, 202 were reported today from China, of which 152 occurred in Beijing. Due to difficulties of information technology, figures received from Chinese authorities yesterday were not included in yesterday’s cumulative update.   The 24 deaths occurred in Canada (2), China (9), Hong Kong SAR (12), and Singapore (1).  "

The change in Viet Nam’s status follows 20 consecutive days (the duration of two incubation periods) since the last new case was detected. “It’s a big day for all of us in Viet Nam and also throughout the world,” said Pascale Brudon, the WHO representative in Hanoi. “WHO congratulates Viet Nam for being the first country to succeed in containing the SARS epidemic.”   The Vietnamese government first made the announcement this morning, but added that the country needs to remain vigilant. The health ministry affirmed its determination to work with WHO to guard against the importation of the virus.   Since SARS was first detected in Viet Nam on 26 February, WHO has collaborated closely with Vietnamese officials to bring the outbreak under control. Key actions have included early recognition of the outbreak, the consolidation of SARS patients in a single hospital, strict infection control, diligent contact tracing, and thorough investigation of all rumoured cases. “We have been capable of containing this epidemic, but the virus is still present in neighbouring countries,” said Brudon.   WHO believes Viet Nam should still maintain a high level of alert since even a single new case of SARS could spark another outbreak. Last week, the Vietnamese health ministry asked the Prime Minister to authorize the closing of the country’s land borders with China. Viet Nam has currently heightened its border surveillance with China, but has stopped short of closing the border.

The team was invited by Shanghai authorities to assess the SARS situation in China’s second largest city.   Among its activities, the team examined the SARS surveillance and reporting system, investigated rumours that the case burden might be higher than officially reported, and visited 10 health facilities, 3 district Centres for Disease Control, and the municipal Centre for Disease Control. The team was given free access to all requested data, patient registries, and facilities, which were visited on very short notice.   The team found no evidence of systematic underreporting of cases, and concluded that the level of preparedness and response was good. Reporting of cases appeared to be open, frank, and accurate. Over the past 3–4 weeks, authorities designated two hospitals as dedicated to the treatment of SARS patients and set up cough and fever clinics. The team also found a very high level of government commitment to tackle the SARS problem.   Many questions remain about why Shanghai has been spared a SARS outbreak on the scale of that seen in Beijing. Had a larger number of cases occurred, it is not certain whether the systems presently in place would have been able to cope.   Situation in Hong Kong Health authorities announced 17 new cases, including 3 in health care workers, and 6 deaths, including the youngest SARS fatality in Hong Kong to date. This was a previously healthy 28-year-old man from the Amoy Gardens housing estate cluster. The other deaths occurred in men aged 38, 40, 61, and 70 years, and a 45-year-old woman. Only one of these patients, the 70-year-old man, had a history of chronic disease.   Of the six deaths announced yesterday, three were from the Amoy Gardens cluster.   Authorities are continuing to investigate a small cluster of cases in the Tung Tau housing estate, where six cases have occurred in vertically linked flats. Presently available epidemiological evidence gives no reason to anticipate an outbreak at the estate on the scale of Amoy Gardens cluster, which involved more than 320 residents of a single building.   A WHO team of environmental and “sick building” experts arrived in Hong Kong to assist local experts in the investigation of possible environmental sources of the virus.   No new cases in Viet Nam for 18 days The SARS situation in Viet Nam has remained stable, at 63 cases and 5 deaths, for 18 consecutive days. Active investigation of numerous rumours has failed to detect a new case of SARS throughout this period. If the trend continues, the country will be removed from the list of affected areas on Monday, making Viet Nam the first country to contain its SARS outbreak.   WHO officials in Viet Nam cautioned against a lapse in the present high state of alert, as the risk persists that a single imported case could seed an outbreak, as happened in February. However, the government showed strong commitment at the highest level from the beginning of the outbreak. Task forces and provincial teams were established and have worked well. Good procedures of infection control were rapidly established and eventually proved effective in preventing further spread among hospital staff.   Should the country experience an imported case, this newly established infrastructure would most likely be effective in preventing another large outbreak.   Update on cases and countries As of today, a cumulative total of 4836 cases with 293 deaths have occurred in 26 countries. This represents an increase of 190 new cases and 19 deaths compared with yesterday. The new deaths occurred in Canada (3), China (7), Hong Kong SAR (6), the Philippines (1), and Singapore (2).  "

Although numerous rumours have been reported, all have been investigated by WHO and government officials, and all suspect cases have been determined to have other causes.   The most recent probable case was detected on 8 April, bringing the cumulative total in Viet Nam to 63 cases. Detection of that case initially brought disappointment, as it occurred after no new cases had been reported over an 8-day period. Since the outbreak was first recognized in Hanoi in late February, 5 deaths have occurred. As of today, five patients remain hospitalized.   Viet Nam was the second country to experience a SARS outbreak. The first was China, where an outbreak began in Guangdong Province in mid-November of last year.   If no new cases are detected by 30 April (a date which marks the end of two incubation periods), Viet Nam could become the first country to be taken off the list of SARS-affected countries. This achievement would also make Viet Nam the first country to successfully contain its SARS outbreak.   SARS was first identified by Dr Carlo Urbani, a WHO infectious disease specialist. Dr Urbani alerted the world to SARS when cases of an unusual and severe respiratory disease began appearing among health staff treating a Chinese-American businessman at the French Hospital in Hanoi. The patient, a 48-year-old resident of Hong Kong, was admitted to hospital on 26 February with fever and respiratory symptoms. His recent travel history included trips to Guangdong Province, Shanghai, and Macao SAR. By 20 March, at least 22 staff at the Hanoi hospital were ill with influenza-like symptoms. Twenty had signs of pneumonia, and two were in serious condition.   The Chinese-American businessman died of SARS in Hong Kong on 13 March. Dr Urbani died of SARS in Thailand on 29 March.   WHO country staff attribute Viet Nam’s success in combating SARS to the quick manner in which the country initially reacted. “After Carlo identified the disease, we were able to influence the hospital to take the right infection control measures very quickly,” said Pascale Brudon, the WHO representative in Viet Nam.   The commitment of the Vietnamese government came soon thereafter, including high-level support for a WHO coordinated response in Hanoi. “The first priority was to contain the disease and monitor each case,” said Brudon. International collaboration to combat SARS came quickly via the Japanese government and Médecins Sans Frontières, who both worked under the umbrella of the WHO initiative in Viet Nam.   Viet Nam was fortunate in that the country had only a single index case, who spent less than 3 days in Hanoi prior to hospitalization. This short time in the community effectively limited opportunities to transmit the SARS virus to a contained hospital environment.   Viet Nam’s northern Quang Ninh province recently began barring Chinese tourists at its overland border with China in an effort to prevent importation of SARS. This move comes ahead of any decision by the Vietnamese national government to seal its border with China indefinitely, as has been recommended by the country’s ministry of health.   Caution urged in the use of diagnostic tests WHO is currently working with four major laboratories to develop a clinically validated diagnostic test for SARS. Standard test reagents are being established to assess the quality of the test and ensure its reliability. When the test has been developed and clinically validated, it can be used reliably to confirm cases of SARS. However, test development and validation are expected to take at least another two weeks.   In the meantime, laboratories in a growing number of countries have developed SARS diagnostic tests, often based on information made available at the WHO web site. It is extremely important for national authorities and medical and hospital staff to understand the limitations of currently available tests. Their use as the basis for treatment decisions may give a false sense of security that can allow persons carrying the SARS virus, and therefore capable of infecting others, to escape detection.   PCR tests can detect genetic material of the SARS virus in various specimens, including blood, stool, respiratory secretions, and tissue samples. Primers, which are the key pieces for a PCR test, have been made publicly available on the WHO web site by laboratories in the WHO network. The primers have since been used by many countries around the world.   These currently available PCR tests are very specific but lack sensitivity. This means that negative test results cannot be relied on as proof that a patient is not infected with the SARS virus.   In the absence of a reliable diagnostic test, national authorities are strongly advised to continue to base decisions concerning what constitutes both a suspect and a probable case of SARS on the present clinical and epidemiological case definition, and not to rely on the results of diagnostic tests. WHO advises that all suspect and probable SARS cases be placed in isolation and managed according to strict procedures of infection control.   All other currently available diagnostic tests also have important limitations. The ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbant assay) test detects antibodies in the serum of SARS patients reliably, but only as from about day 21 after the onset of clinical signs and symptoms. Immunofluorescence assay tests detect antibodies in serum of SARS patients, but only after about day 10 following the onset of clinical signs and symptoms. Moreover, the test is demanding. Reliable results depend on the use of fixed SARS virus, an immunofluorescence microscope, and an experienced microscopist.   Virus in specimens from SARS patients can also be detected by infecting cell cultures and growing the virus. Once isolated, the virus must be identified as the SARS virus with further tests. Cell culture, which is the only method of demonstrating the existence of a live virus, is a very demanding and time-consuming test.   Update on cases and countries   As of today, a cumulative total of 4649 cases with 274 deaths have been reported from 26 countries. This represents an additional 210 cases and 11 deaths when compared with yesterday. The new deaths were reported in China (5) and Hong Kong SAR (6).   In China, the Ministry of Health has today informed WHO of 180 newly reported probable cases. The breakdown by location is Beijing (103), Inner Mongolia (23), Guangdong (15), Tianjin (13), Hebei (12), Shanxi (11), and one case each in Henan, Guangxi, and Sichuan. These latest figures bring the cumulative number of probable cases reported in China to 2601. Among health workers, a total of 38 new probable cases were reported from Beijing (17), Tianjin (9), Hebei (5), Inner Mongolia (5), Shanxi (1), and Guangdong (1).   Beijing reported 3 deaths, Shanxi 1, and Guangdong 1, bringing the cumulative number of deaths in China to 115. The fact that cases continue to occur in health workers underscores the need for better infection control in hospitals. In Beijing, WHO is still awaiting data giving dates of onset and the location of cases in order to fully assess the situation.  "

The new figures bring the cumulative number of reported probable cases in China to 2422.   Twenty-one provinces have now reported probable cases, with another five provinces reporting suspected cases.   Of the 125 new cases, 24 occurred among health workers, including 17 in Beijing. Altogether, China has reported 541 cases in health workers during the course of its SARS outbreak, which began in mid-November 2002.   Beijing has reported the highest number of new cases (89), followed by Guangdong (15), and Inner Mongolia (11). Beijing reported 4 new deaths, bringing the cumulative number of SARS deaths in China to 110.   With a cumulative total of 1359 cases, Guangdong has the highest total number of probable cases, followed by Beijing, with 774 probable cases.   The number of reported cases in Beijing is increasing on a daily basis, and WHO is following the situation there closely. Data provided to date do not allow determination of whether newly reported cases are old SARS cases only now coming to light, or newly detected cases. Better interpretation of reports, and a more complete assessment of the underlying situation, require information on date of onset and location of cases. WHO has proposed to Beijing city government officials a meeting, scheduled for tomorrow, of WHO technical staff with Beijing disease experts in order to review reporting procedures.   Yesterday Beijing authorities closed elementary and middle schools early as an extension of the already planned national May Day holidays. Schools have been asked to inform parents, teachers, and visitors about the symptoms of SARS. Persons with symptoms have been asked not to visit schools. School authorities have been asked to conduct close monitoring and to send home any students, teachers, other staff, and visitors showing symptoms suggestive of SARS.   In Shanghai, the WHO team of experts continued visits to hospitals and the Shanghai Centre for Disease Control. The team has also examined procedures for contact tracing. The team will present its findings tomorrow and return to Beijing on Saturday.   Update on cases and countries As of today, a cumulative total of 4439 cases with 263 deaths have been reported from 26 countries. This represents an increase of 158 new cases and 12 deaths compared with yesterday. The deaths occurred in Canada (2), China (4), Hong Kong SAR (4), and Singapore (2). Bulgaria reported its first case today.  "
"2003","http://www.who.int/csr/don/2003_04_24/en/index.html"," Avian influenza in the Netherlands   24 April 2003 Disease Outbreak Reported   Outbreaks of a of highly pathogenic strain of avian influenza virus A (H7N7) have been reported in various poultry farms in the Netherlands since February 2003. Recent cases of the disease in poultry have also been reported in Belgium.   While avian influenza strains normally infect exclusively poultry, Dutch authorities have reported that the H7N7 strain has now jumped the species barrier, causing one death and more than 80 cases of mild disease in humans.   A 57-year-old veterinarian who visited a poultry farm affected by the (H7N7) strain died on 17 April of acute respiratory distress syndrome in the Netherlands. H7N7 influenza virus was isolated from the patient. No other respiratory pathogen was detected in a series of laboratory tests.   The detection of the H7N7 avian influenza strain in humans is the most recent case in which an avian influenza virus has crossed species to affect humans. In Hong Kong in 1997, the H5N1 strain of avian influenza caused its first outbreak in humans, with 18 cases and 6 deaths. In mid-February 2003, again in Hong Kong, the H5N1 strain infected two persons, causing one death.   Since the beginning of the H7N7 outbreak in the Netherlands in late February, there have been 83 confirmed cases of human H7N7. The majority of these cases (79) exhibited conjunctivitis, and 13 of them displayed mild influenza-like illness. Three family members of 2 poultry worker have also fallen ill with a minor respiratory disease, suggesting a possible chain of human-to-human transmission. Affected poultry in the Netherlands are being slaughtered as a control measures. Mass culling of poultry proved effective, in both Hong Kong outbreaks, in preventing further cases in humans.   Close investigation, including tracing of the veterinarian’s contacts, has not revealed any transmission of the disease (in its severe form, as opposed to the much milder conjunctivitis) to other persons. Based on available evidence, WHO concludes that the death is an isolated case, as no efficient human-to-human transmission of the avian H7N7 influenza virus strain has been detected.   In accordance with WHO’s pandemic preparedness plan for influenza, WHO recommends that in countries where initial cases of H7N7 were detected, surveillance and diagnosis of the avian H7N7 virus should be enhanced in humans and susceptible animals (including chickens, turkeys, and pigs).   In addition, countries should initiate specific investigations to increase understanding of possible transmission patterns. Specific personal protection, such as prophylactic use of the antiviral drug oseltamivir for agricultural workers in contact with H7N7-affected poultry, has also been recommended by national authorities in the Netherlands and in Belgium.   WHO advises that persons in contact with H7N7-affected poultry flocks should be on guard for any signs and symptoms of respiratory disease. If symptoms arise, they should consult a doctor, who will then initiate laboratory testing and reporting to health officials.   WHO emphasizes that these heightened surveillance measures will help in the timely detection of any further transmission of H7N7 to humans and to prevent its possible spread.   The WHO Global Influenza Surveillance Network is currently assembling a test kit for H7N7 that will be ready for use in three weeks. As a precautionary measure, the network is also working on the development of a vaccine for H7N7.  "
"2003","http://www.who.int/csr/don/2003_04_23/en/index.html"," Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) Multi-country outbreak Update 37  WHO extends its SARS-related travel advice to Beijing and Shanxi Province in China and to Toronto Canada   23 April 2003 Disease Outbreak Reported   As a result of ongoing assessments as to the nature of outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in Beijing and Shanxi Province, China, and in Toronto, Canada, WHO is now recommending, as a measure of precaution, that persons planning to travel to these destinations consider postponing all but essential travel. This temporary advice, which is an extension of travel advice previously issued for Guangdong Province and Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, China will be reassessed in three weeks time.   Following global alerts about cases of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), issued by WHO on 12 and 15 March, national authorities have heightened surveillance for suspect and probable cases. In many countries, prompt detection and isolation of initial cases have prevented further transmission altogether or held additional cases to a very small number.   On 27 March, WHO recommended additional measures aimed at preventing the travel-related spread of SARS. These recommended measures, which include screening of air passengers departing from certain areas, continue to apply.   On 2 April, WHO recommended that persons travelling to Hong Kong Special Administrative Region and Guangdong Province, China consider postponing all but essential travel. This temporary recommendation has been reassessed daily and remains in effect.   Subsequent information from the Chinese government about the magnitude of the SARS outbreaks in Beijing and Shanxi Province has been carefully reviewed by WHO. This assessment has considered the magnitude of the outbreak, including both the number of prevalent cases and the daily number of new cases, the extent of local chains of transmission, and evidence that travellers are becoming infected while in one area and then subsequently exporting the disease elsewhere. On the basis of this assessment, WHO is extending its 2 April travel advice to include Beijing and Shanxi Province.   Using the same criteria, WHO has assessed the SARS situation in Toronto, Canada. The outbreak in this area has continued to grow in magnitude and has affected groups outside the initial risk groups of hospital workers, their families and other close person-to-person contacts, although all the cases reported have identified links to known SARS cases. In addition, a small number of persons with SARS,  now in other countries  in the world, appear to have acquired the infection while in Toronto. On the basis of this information, WHO is also including Toronto in the extension of its SARS-related travel advice.   This advice will be re-examined in three weeks time, which is twice the maximum incubation period of SARS.   The WHO travel advice is issued in order to protect public health and reduce opportunities for further international spread. SARS is a new disease, first recognized in late February, that has spread along the routes of international air travel. As of 22 April, a cumulative total of 3947 cases had been reported from 25 countries on five continents. Precautionary measures aim to reduce the impact of SARS and contain the disease while it is still in a relatively early stage.   The SARS situation is assessed on a daily basis to determine whether other areas need to be included in the travel advice and if additional precautionary measures are required.   All WHO SARS alerts, travel advice, daily cumulative case counts and other information are available at the WHO web site.  "

To date, 8 probable and 14 suspect SARS cases have been linked to the market.   The first case in the cluster, a 64-year-old worker at the market, died on 12 April. His illness has been linked to a 31 March visit to a relative hospitalized at Singapore General Hospital. Other probable cases in this cluster include two additional workers at the market, a taxi driver who carried the first patient from his home to the market, and four relatives, including 3 grandchildren of market workers.   Rigorous contact tracing has linked all 14 suspected SARS cases, associated with the market, to workers, visitors, and family members.   In an effort to contain the outbreak, health authorities have issued some 1,200 home quarantine orders. Visitors to the market during the period of 5 to 19 April have been urged to watch for symptoms and call a hotline for immediate medical assistance should symptoms arise.   Data available to WHO indicate that early diagnosis and prompt supportive care improve clinical prognosis.   As of today, Singapore has reported 186 probable SARS cases, with 16 deaths. Tracing and follow-up of contacts, and isolation of patients in designated wards of a single SARS hospital have been key features of the government’s response to SARS.   China Chinese authorities have now reported a cumulative total of 2001 SARS cases with 92 deaths. Of the 482 cases reported in Beijing, 78 are said to have occurred in health care workers. In the first reports on atypical pneumonia in China, submitted in mid-February, approximately 30% of cases were said to occur in health care workers.   Recent reports indicate that SARS has now spread to some of China’s poorest provinces, including western Guangxi, northern Gansu, and Inner Mongolia. Chinese authorities have announced plans to send SARS prevention teams to Shanxi, Inner Mongolia, Henan, and Ningxia, where cases have also been recently reported, as well as to Guangdong.   A WHO team is currently in Shanghai investigating the extent of the SARS outbreak in the country’s largest city. Officials from Beijing, Hong Kong, Taiwan, and Macau will meet tomorrow in Beijing to coordinate policies for responding to SARS. The meeting underscores the international dimensions of the SARS outbreak, which is increasingly being viewed as a problem beyond the control of any single government acting alone.   Update on cases and countries As of today, a cumulative total of 3947 probable cases with 228 deaths have been reported to WHO from 25 countries. The 11 new deaths were reported in China (6) and Hong Kong SAR (5).  "

This latest report comes after Sunday’s announcement of 339 previously undisclosed SARS patients. There is no breakdown of the number of patients in regular and military hospitals. The new numbers bring the total of confirmed cases in China to 1,959.   In an indication that the Chinese leadership is now taking seriously the need for transparency in SARS reporting, the health minister and Beijing mayor, both of whom played down the seriousness of SARS, were removed from their Communist Party posts.   China also reduced its traditional week-long May Day holiday to a single, a period when hundreds of thousands of people generally travel throughout the country. “The purpose of such an act is to prevent the massive movement of people and the possible spread of the disease,” said Gao Qiang, an executive vice health minister.   A six-member WHO team also arrived this morning to investigate SARS in Shanghai. Shanghai has officially confirmed two probable cases of SARS. No deaths have yet been reported in Shanghai.

"2003","http://www.who.int/csr/don/2003_04_19/en/index.html"," Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) - multi-country outbreak - Update 34  Unanswered questions: a critical point in the evolution of SARS   19 April 2003 Disease Outbreak Reported   As probable SARS cases continue to be reported from a growing number of countries, WHO is taking stock of what is known about the new disease, particularly concerning its mode of spread, and what remains a puzzle.   The agent that causes SARS has now been conclusively identified. The SARS virus is a new coronavirus unlike any other known human or animal virus in the Coronavirus family. Because the virus is new, much about its behaviour is poorly understood. Key questions, which are undergoing intense study, include stages in the course of infection when virus shedding may be highest, and the various concentrations of virus in different body fluids. Scientists are also working to determine the amount of time the virus can survive in the environment on both dry surfaces and in suspension, including in faecal matter.   The vast majority of countries reporting probable SARS cases are dealing with a small number of imported cases. Experience has shown that when these cases are promptly detected, isolated, and managed according to strict procedures of infection control, further spread to hospital staff and family members either does not occur at all or results in a very small number of secondary infections. These experiences confirm abundant early evidence that the SARS virus spreads, in the vast majority of cases, through exposure to respiratory droplets during close face-to-face contact.   However, information now emerging from outbreaks in Hong Kong and Canada is raising some important new questions about SARS. In Hong Kong, a large and sudden cluster of almost simultaneous cases (321) seen in residents of the Amoy Gardens housing estate has raised the possibility of transmission from an environmental source.   In addition, reports from Hong Kong health authorities indicate that patients in this cluster depart in some ways from the previously established clinical picture. The disease appears to be more severe both in Amoy residents and in related cases among hospital staff. Around 20% of Amoy-related cases require intensive care, compared with 10% seen in non-Amoy cases. Some deaths are now occurring in younger, previously healthy persons as well as in the elderly and persons with underlying disease. Around 66% of Amoy Gardens patients present with diarrhoea as a symptom, compared with 2% to 7% of cases in other outbreaks.   Speculation centres on whether these cases represent infection with high virus loads, as might occur following exposure to a concentrated environmental source, or whether the virus may have mutated into a more virulent form. Viruses in the Coronavirus family are known to mutate frequently.   In Canada, concern has centred around a cluster of 31 suspect and probable cases in members of a charismatic religious group, the health care workers who have treated them, and close family and social contacts. The outbreak is particularly disturbing because of its potential to move into the wider community. Large meetings of the religious group at two events, on 28 and 29 March, may have led to multiple additional exposures, especially among the members of this close-knit religious group.   Intense contact tracing, home quarantine, and close follow-up by health officials may work to prevent further spread of cases in the general community. The index case in this cluster has been traced to contact, in a hospital emergency room, with a subsequently fatal SARS case. The outbreak is regarded as a test case of whether rigorous contact tracing and other stringent public health measures can contain further spread even when very large numbers of persons may have been exposed.   This index case has also been linked to three of four SARS cases concentrated in the same block of a 247-unit condominium in Toronto. As the fourth case could not be linked to direct contact with a SARS patient, some speculation arose concerning possible environmental contamination within the building as the source of the fourth infection. However, all four cases occurred in early April, with 4 April being the date of onset of the fourth case. The incubation period has now passed with no further cases detected. There appears to be little risk that the case arose from an environmental source.   Viet Nam A week has passed since Viet Nam officials reported a new probable case of SARS. No new deaths have occurred during this period. The situation in Hanoi seems to have stabilized. Following the introduction of infection control measures in the French Hospital, the transmission of SARS appears to have been contained. Ten patients are now listed as recovering from SARS, none of whom is listed as in critical condition.   The Vietnamese government is considering closing its land border with China in an attempt to prevent the importation of SARS cases. In a proposal submitted to the Prime Minister by the Ministry of Health, the 1,130 kilometre border with China would be sealed indefinitely to overland visitors.   WHO officials in Viet Nam said earlier this week that while Viet Nam appears to have controlled the SARS outbreak within its borders, it still faces the threat of massive importation of the disease from China.   Update on cases and countries As of today, a cumulative total of 3547 cases with 182 deaths have been reported from 25 countries. Compared with yesterday, 12 new deaths, all in Hong Kong SAR, have been reported.  "
"2003","http://www.who.int/csr/don/2003_04_18/en/index.html"," Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) - multi-country outbreak - Update 33  Update on Hong Kong and China, first SARS case reported in India   18 April 2003 Disease Outbreak Reported   Hong Kong: investigation of Amoy Gardens cluster The Hong Kong Secretary for Environment, Transport and Works, in collaboration with eight other government agencies, has released the results of an extensive investigation of an unusual cluster of SARS cases concentrated in the Amoy Gardens housing estate.   The investigation, which drew on epidemiological, environmental, and laboratory studies, has identified sewage contaminated with the SARS virus as the probable point source of exposure. Epidemiological investigation has focused on the role of a 33-year-old man who developed symptoms of SARS on 14 March and visited a relative in Block E, Amoy Gardens on 14 and 19 March. His symptoms at that time included diarrhoea.   Based on the epidemiology of the outbreak, officials believe that this patient, who is linked to the infection of two relatives and two nurses, was the source of the outbreak. Subsequent rapid spread to other residents (321 cases of as 15 April) is thought to have involved defective U-traps in bathrooms, an amplifying effect of bathroom exhaust fans, a cracked sewer vent pipe serving Block E, and an aerodynamic effect in a lightwell to which bathroom windows opened.   Laboratory investigations confirmed the presence of the SARS virus in a swab from the toilet bowl in the bathroom of a SARS patient, but not in numerous other environmental samples.   “This is a plausible hypothesis,” says David Heymann, Executive Director of communicable diseases at WHO. “This is the kind of study that is needed to find what it is in the environment that is transmitting this disease.”   Further work will be needed to reach firm conclusions about the source of the outbreak and the unusual way in which infection has spread.   The study found no epidemiological or laboratory evidence that the SARS virus was transmitted by air, water, or infected dust aerosols. “It is reassuring that speculations about a possible airborne transmission have not been borne out by the evidence available to date,” says Heymann.   The transmission of SARS within the Amoy Gardens estate is the first known instance involving a possible environmental spread of the virus. Thorough multi-disciplinary investigation of this unusual outbreak, as is now under way, is fully warranted. Once the outbreak is fully understood, the next important step will be to develop measures that can prevent other instances of environmental spread occurring under similar circumstances.   China advises officials on SARS China’s top leaders cautioned officials this morning not to cover up the spread of SARS. Yesterday, during an urgent meeting of China’s highest ruling body presided over by President Hu Jintao, Beijing explicitly warned against the covering up of SARS cases and demanded the “accurate, timely and honest reporting of the SARS situation,” according to Xinhua, the country’s official news agency. China’s leaders called SARS a serious threat to the nation’s reform, development and stability, adding that party and government leaders would be held accountable for the situations in their respective jurisdictions.   Earlier this week, the WHO Beijing team estimated that Beijing may have as many as 200 cases of SARS, rather than the 37 officially reported. The team recommended that Beijing improve its reporting system, possibly using as a model procedures followed in Guangdong Province, where the daily SARS reports are considered reliable and transparent. WHO experts also recommended that Beijing revise its definition of what constitutes a “suspect” SARS case.   At present, many patients reported by Beijing as “suspect” would be classified as “probable” according to the case definition set out by WHO and used in official notifications of cases to WHO. As WHO reports only probable cases in its daily cumulative totals, such a change on the part of Beijing would result in a large increase in the number of cases notified to WHO.   First SARS case reported in India India reported its first case of SARS yesterday. The National Institute of Virology in the western coastal state of Goa confirmed the presence of the new coronavirus which causes SARS, in samples from the patient. He is said to have recovered, and is still being kept in isolation after visiting Singapore, Hong Kong, and briefly stopping over in Mumbai.   There have been fears that if the SARS virus reached India, it could spread rapidly in the subcontinent’s crowded cities and health facilities. WHO officials believe it is good news that the one case has been detected and reported, as this indicates that the surveillance system is on high alert and working well. As has been demonstrated in many countries, prompt detection of new cases, proper management, and efficient contact tracing can prevent isolated cases from infecting others.   Update on cases and countries As of today, a cumulative total of 3461 cases with 170 deaths have been reported from 25 countries on five continents. This represents an increase of 72 new cases and 5 deaths since the last WHO update. The deaths occurred in Hong Kong SAR (4) and Singapore (1).  "
"2003","http://www.who.int/csr/don/2003_04_17/en/index.html"," Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) - multi-country outbreak - Update 32  Situation in China and Hong Kong, status of diagnostic tests   17 April 2003   Disease Outbreak Reported   China Chinese authorities have today reported 12 new cases of SARS. Nine new cases were reported from Guangdong Province, and one each in Inner Mongolia and Sichuan Province. Ningxia, a poor province in the remote western part of the country, announced its first case today.   Beijing reported no new cases and no new deaths.   Today’s figures do not include cases in Beijing’s military hospitals. The military hospitals, which are not obliged by Chinese law to report cases to health authorities, have been the focus of considerable rumours over the past several days. A WHO team began visits to Beijing’s military hospitals yesterday.   The recent decision of military hospitals in Guangdong Province to report SARS cases to the authorities may set an important precedent. WHO staff in China have been further encouraged by the presence of national surveillance and reporting teams in provinces that are now reporting cases. The presence of national SARS teams actively searching for cases is a welcome sign that the severity of the SARS threat is being taken seriously by the government.   An additional WHO team will be travelling to Shanghai next week.   Hong Kong: investigation of the Amoy Gardens cluster The Hong Kong Department of Health, together with the Department of Environment, Transport and Works, has today released the results of an extensive investigation into the possible cause of a large cluster of SARS cases among residents in the Amoy Gardens housing estate. The report draws on findings from numerous studies designed to determine whether an environmental source of the SARS virus might explain the large and unusual cluster of SARS cases.   As of 15 April, health authorities had reported a total of 321 individuals affected by SARS who are residents in Amoy Gardens. A large proportion of cases are concentrated in vertically linked flats in a single building, Block E.   Attention has focused on possible transmission via the sewage system. Among several unusual features, the Amoy cluster includes a high proportion of cases presenting with diarrhoea, estimated at about 60%. In most other clusters of cases, diarrhoea has typically been seen in only 2% to 7% of cases.   WHO epidemiologists are now studying the report, which was submitted to WHO earlier today by Hong Kong’s Department of Health.   Status of diagnostic tests Scientists in the WHO network of collaborating laboratories met in Geneva yesterday to map out research priorities for the coming month. The network also announced conclusive proof, from animal trials, that a new coronavirus, discovered by the group last month, is the agent that causes SARS.   With the cause of SARS now proven, network scientists are giving top priority to the development of better diagnostic tests. The first step is the development of a data bank of specimens from a range of SARS patients in different countries. The scientists are also building a bank of specimens taken from individual patients at different stages of disease, including recovery.   Such a time-series of specimens will be vital in developing a test that is capable of detecting virus at the first stage when people become capable of infecting others. It will also help determine the stage in the course of the illness when recovered patients can safely return to their jobs and families with no risk of infecting others.   Other plans for the coming weeks include the development of a genetic library of specimens from SARS patients from different parts of the world. It is not yet known whether genetic differences in the coronavirus, which has now been fully sequenced by several network laboratories, will have significance for work on drug and vaccine research and development.   Existing PCR diagnostic tests are insufficiently powerful to rule out, with confidence, the presence of the virus in suspect or probable SARS cases early in the course of the disease.   WHO has been concerned that use of the current PCR test kit, which is being made available by a German biotechnology company initially at no cost, may produce test results that give a false sense of security, allowing persons carrying the virus to slip past undetected.   Without a more reliable diagnostic tool, hospital staff confronted with a suspect SARS case have no option other than to isolate patients and manage them according to strict infection control practices as precautionary measures. Such measures are stressful for patients and place a considerable strain on health services.   Update on cases and countries As of today, a cumulative total of 3389 cases with 165 deaths have been reported from twenty five countries. Countries reporting their first probable cases on today’s list include Australia (3) and Mongolia (3).   A large number of suspect SARS cases turn out, on further investigation, to have other, common causes.  "
"2003","http://www.who.int/csr/don/2003_04_16/en/index.html"," Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) - multi-country outbreak - Update 31  Coronavirus never before seen in humans is the cause of SARS   Unprecedented collaboration identifies new pathogen in record time   16 April 2003 Disease Outbreak Reported    GENEVA -- Today, the World Health Organization announced that a new pathogen, a member of the coronavirus family never before seen in humans, is the cause of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). The speed at which this virus was identified is the result of the close international collaboration of 13 laboratories from 10 countries. While many lines of evidence have found strong associations between this virus and the disease over the last weeks, final confirmation came today.   “The pace of SARS research has been astounding,” said Dr. David Heymann, Executive Director, WHO Communicable Diseases programmes. “Because of an extraordinary collaboration among laboratories from countries around the world, we now know with certainty what causes SARS.”   The successful identification of the coronavirus means that scientists can now confidently turn to other SARS challenges. For example, various laboratories continue to work to unravel the genetic information of the SARS virus and compare the sequences obtained from viruses in different parts of the world. Experts are gathering at WHO this week to map future work on SARS.   “Today, the collaboration continues as top laboratory researchers have come to WHO to design the next steps, a strategy for transforming these basic research discoveries into diagnostic tools which will help us to successfully control this disease,” said Heymann. “Now we can move away from methods like isolation and quarantines and move aggressively towards modern intervention strategies including specific treatments and eventually vaccination. With the establishment of the causative agent, we are a crucial step closer.”   This collaboration has brought together leading scientific expertise, and was established after WHO issued a global alert on SARS on 12 March 2003. The priority has been to find the cause and to develop diagnostic tests. Two laboratories in China recently joined this network of laboratories from Canada, France, Germany, Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of China, Japan, the Netherlands, Singapore, the United Kingdom, and the United States of America.   “Today, the first part of the mission of our network has been fulfilled, as researchers have both detected a hitherto unknown virus and established it as the cause of SARS. The new coronavirus has been named by WHO and member laboratories as “SARS virus, ” said Dr Albert Osterhaus, the Director of Virology at Erasmus Medical Center in Rotterdam. Erasmus completed the work to definitely prove that the new coronavirus causes SARS.   Over the past three weeks, due to the urgency surrounding the worldwide threat to health of SARS and early indications this was a new member of the coronavirus family, research has proceeded under the assumption that SARS was caused by a new coronavirus.   The 13 laboratories have been working on meeting Koch’s postulates, necessary to prove disease causation. These postulates stipulate that to be the causal agent, a pathogen must meet four conditions: it must be found in all cases of the disease, it must be isolated from the host and grown in pure culture, it must reproduce the original disease when introduced into a susceptible host, and it must be found in the experimental host so infected.   Credit for the coronavirus findings, which definitively pinpoints the cause of SARS, is attributed to the 13 laboratories, working in conjunction with WHO.   “The people in this network have put aside profit and prestige to work together to find the cause of this new disease and to find way new ways of fighting it,” said Dr Klaus Stöhr, WHO virologist and the coordinator of the collaborative research network. “In this globalized world, such collaboration is the only way forward in tackling emerging diseases.”   WHO and the network of laboratories dedicate their detection and characterization of the SARS virus to Dr Carlo Urbani, the WHO scientist who first alerted the world to the existence of SARS in Hanoi, Vietnam, and who died from the disease in Bangkok on 29 March 2003.

"2003","http://www.who.int/csr/don/2003_04_15/en/index.html"," Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) - multi-country outbreak - Update 30  Status of diagnostic test, significance of “super spreaders”, situation in China   15 April 2003 Disease Outbreak Reported   SARS diagnostic test kit made available to members of WHO network Scientists participating in the WHO collaborative network of laboratories have developed several diagnostic tests for SARS. These include a so-called “PCR” test, which allows detection of the distinctive genetic information of a virus.   Primers, which are the key pieces for a PCR test, were made publicly available by network laboratories on the open WHO web site ( http://www.who.int/csr/sars/primers/en/ ) on 4 April. The primers have since been used by numerous countries around the world.   WHO scientists are now increasingly optimistic that the current PCR diagnostic test for SARS can rapidly be fine-tuned to a stage ready for roll out. Fine-tuning is needed because of important limitations in the ability of the current test to rule out the presence of coronavirus in SARS cases.   Yesterday, the Bernhard-Nocht Institute for Tropical Medicine in Hamburg, Germany informed WHO that primers developed there are being made available, in the form of a ready-to-use kit, by a Hamburg-based biotechnology firm. Apart from ease of use, the test kit has the advantage of built-in quality control. WHO was further informed by the Hamburg Institute that the test will be offered at no cost to laboratories participating in the WHO collaborative network.   The network, which includes leading laboratories from ten countries, was set up last month to expedite identification of the SARS causative agent and, in parallel, to rapidly develop a diagnostic test.   Initial testing of the kit by network members is expected to quickly yield the data needed to assess the test’s performance, in comparison with primers developed by other WHO network laboratories. The ability to detect persons infected with the SARS virus at an early stage is a key measure of performance. WHO has been concerned that weaknesses in earlier experimental tests for SARS would allow too many virus carriers to slip past undetected.   Existing PCR tests are very specific but may not detect all patients who are excreting coronavirus. Early and reliable detection of the SARS virus in samples will be of great assistance in helping health care staff determine which persons presenting with fever and other suspicion-arousing symptoms should be immediately isolated and managed according to strict procedures of infection control. Such procedures will, in turn, greatly reduce the likelihood that infection will spread to others.   Various WHO network laboratories are endeavouring to improve their PCR testing protocols and primers to increase their reliability.   The Bernhard-Nocht Institute is a member of the WHO network of collaborating laboratories. The rapid development of the test kit is one example of how scientific knowledge, being generated by dedicated scientists, can be rapidly translated into a practical control tool.   Explanation of so-called SARS “super-spreaders” “Super-spreader” is a term that has been used to describe certain individuals with atypical pneumonia, now recognized as cases of SARS, who have been implicated in spreading the disease to numerous other individuals.   The phenomenon of a “super-spreader”, which is not a recognized medical condition, dates back to the early days of the outbreak. At that time, when SARS was just becoming known as a severe new disease, many patients were thought to be suffering from atypical pneumonia having another cause, and were therefore not treated as special cases requiring special precautions of isolation and infection control.   As a result, stringent infection control measures were not in place. In the absence of protective measures, many health care workers, relatives, and hospital visitors were exposed to the SARS virus and subsequently developed SARS.   Since infection control measures have been put in place, the number of new cases of SARS arising from a single SARS source case has been significantly reduced.   When investigating current chains of continuing transmission, it is important to look for points in the history of case detection and patient management when procedures for infection control may have broken down.   China The WHO team of experts in Beijing was today granted permission to visit military hospitals. The situation of SARS cases in certain military hospitals has been the source of numerous rumours concerning the magnitude of the SARS outbreak. The WHO team has so far visited one such hospital but hopes to visit others soon.   The decision by Beijing authorities is a welcome indication of China’s willingness to come to terms with the SARS outbreak on the mainland. Yesterday, China’s president Hu Jintao said on state television that he was “very worried” by SARS.   The WHO Beijing team is expected to finish its preliminary investigation on the status of SARS in China tomorrow. Additional WHO teams will travel soon to other parts of China.   Update on cases and countries As of today, a cumulative total of 3235 cases of SARS, with 154 deaths, have been reported from 22 countries. This represents an increase of 66 new cases and ten deaths compared with the previous day. Nine of the ten deaths occurred in Hong Kong SAR. One death was reported in Singapore.  "

The largest number of cases occurred in Shanxi Province, where 47 new cases were reported. In addition, two provinces reported SARS cases for the first time – 10 in Inner Mongolia and 3 in Fujian.   The reports indicate that the nationwide surveillance system, recently introduced by Chinese authorities, is working to detect and report cases. However, questions remain about the capacity of some provinces to cope with the challenge of SARS.   Last week, the interim report of the WHO investigative team concluded that the health system in Guangdong Province, where the first recognized cases of SARS occurred in mid-November, had responded well to the outbreak. However, the report noted many concerns about the ability of other provinces, that lack Guangdong’s strong health system, to respond promptly and effectively to SARS.   While Beijing authorities appear to have contained transmission in some hospitals, they have not yet granted WHO experts permission to visit military hospitals, which have been the focus of numerous rumours. WHO staff in Beijing have expressed particular concern about the official response to rumours and the apparent absence of rigorous contact tracing.   WHO is currently exploring ways to strengthen its support to China. Shanghai has requested a visit from a WHO team. Teams to meet this request and follow up on other needs in China are now being assembled by WHO and will soon travel to China.   Status of scientific knowledge Canadian scientists working around the clock have completed full sequencing of the genome of the SARS virus. This is a major step forward that will boost the development of better diagnostic tests and underpin work on a vaccine.   The rapid sequencing of the SARS virus genome was facilitated by collaboration with numerous other scientists, also working non-stop, at laboratories in a WHO network set up in mid-March.   A PCR test, developed by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, has been shown to be ten times more sensitive than previous PCR tests for SARS. WHO experts hope that the test will be ready for roll out by the end of this week.   Status of clinical knowledge Data available to WHO indicate that 96% of persons developing SARS recover spontaneously. The focus now is on the roughly 4% who are dying. WHO will hold a clinical teleconference on Wednesday to gather international experiences in the management of SARS patients and pool data on the results of various therapeutic regimens.   Update on cases and countries As of today, a cumulative total of 3169 cases of SARS, with 144 deaths, have been reported to WHO from 21 countries. This represents an increase of 213 cases and 25 deaths since the last update on Saturday.   Indonesia, the Philippines, and Sweden report their first probable cases (1 in each country) today. Japan, which had previously reported four probable cases, was removed from the list as these cases were determined to have other causes.   China, with 1418 cases and 64 deaths, remains the most seriously affected area. Hong Kong SAR, with 1190 cases and 47 deaths, is the second most seriously affected area. Three of the deaths in Hong Kong over the weekend occurred in persons under the age of 50, marking a departure from a previously pattern in which SARS caused deaths primarily in the elderly or in persons with pre-existing disease.

Areas are added to the list following indication that chains of local transmission are occurring. The greatest concern arises when cases occur outside the established risk groups of health care workers and persons in close face-to-face contact with patients, such as household contacts and hospital visitors.   In addition to Beijing, other affected areas in China include Guangdong Province, Hong Kong SAR, Shanxi Province, and Taiwan Province. Toronto, Singapore, and Hanoi are also listed as affected.   In most other countries reporting SARS cases, the disease remains confined to a few imported cases, with no or very little spread of infection to others.   China A WHO team of five experts has been invited by the Beijing Health Bureau to visit health facilities and review the SARS situation in Beijing. The invitation followed WHO concern about management of the SARS situation by health authorities, particularly in relation to case reporting and contact tracing.   The meetings, which began on Friday, will continue throughout next week. Specific objectives are to support the strengthening of surveillance and reporting, clinical management, infection control, and laboratory evaluation of cases.   No reports from China were received today.   Hong Kong Hong Kong has today reported a cumulative total of 1108 cases with 35 deaths. This represents an increase of 49 new cases admitted to hospital with symptoms of SARS, and 3 deaths when compared with yesterday. Of the cases newly admitted to hospital, 3 are in health care workers, and 11 are from the Amoy Gardens housing estate.   The majority of Hong Kong’s cases are clustered in hospitals and in the densely populated Amoy Gardens housing estate. Health authorities are continuing to investigate a possible environmental factor that may explain the concentration of cases in a single wing of a single building, Block E. Health officials are also investigating whether an outbreak in a second housing estate may be related to the Amoy Gardens outbreak.   The Department of Health has today posted on its web site a detailed list of buildings where residents have developed SARS.   Singapore Singapore has today reported a cumulative total of 147 SARS cases of which 60 remain hospitalized, with 15 in intensive care. Recent concern has centered on clusters of SARS cases seen in health workers, inpatients, and visitors at Singapore General Hospital and Ton Tock Seng Hospital.   WHO has collaborated with health authorities in investigations and contact tracing that have linked most cases in the hospital outbreaks to a single “super-spreader.” This patient was treated at Ton Tock Seng Hospital from 5 to 20 March, where he is thought to have become infected. He was subsequently admitted to Singapore General Hospital on 24 March. The patient showed a very atypical clinical course before being isolated on 2 April. This late isolation is thought to explain, in part, the large number of exposed and infected individuals linked to the single patient.   Ongoing investigations have linked the outbreaks at Singapore General Hospital, Ton Tock Seng Hospital, and other hospitals in Singapore to clear trains of transmission   Viet Nam In Viet Nam, one new case was reported and one case was removed from the list. The cumulative number of reported cases (62) remains the same as yesterday. High vigilance, excellent contact tracing, and good infection control are in place and are expected to keep the number of new cases, associated with the initial outbreak, small.   Canada Health Canada is today reporting 101 probable SARS cases. All Canadian cases have occurred in persons who have travelled to Asia or had contact with SARS cases in the household or in a health-care setting. Ontario is reporting 98 probable cases. Three probable cases are reported in British Columbia.   Update on cases and countries As of today, a cumulative total of 2960 cases, with 119 deaths, have been reported from 19 countries. This represents an increase of 70 cases and 3 deaths when compared with yesterday. No reports from China were received today.   The 3 new deaths were reported in Hong Kong SAR. New cases were reported in Canada (3), Hong Kong (49), Taiwan, China (2), Singapore (14), Thailand (1), and the United Kingdom (1).   12 April 2003 Disease Outbreak Reported  "
"2003","http://www.who.int/csr/don/2003_04_11/en/index.html"," Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) - multi-country outbreak - Update 27  One month into the global SARS outbreak: Status of the outbreak and lessons for the immediate future   11 April 2003 Disease Outbreak Reported    One month after declaring SARS a global threat to health, Dr David L. Heymann, Executive Director of WHO’s communicable disease programmes, gives an overview of where we stand with the epidemic – what is known about this emerging disease and the unique virus that causes it, and how outbreaks in the “hot zones” around the world are evolving. He gives a chronology of key events and explains some of the actions taken to curb further spread. He also explains why SARS poses a particularly serious threat to health, and looks at the many puzzles this unusual disease presents. Several lessons for future infectious disease emergencies, including the next influenza pandemic and a possible bioterrorist attack, are also described.  Status of the outbreak  “Hot zones” of concern  China  Canada  Hong Kong  Viet Nam  Singapore  New coronavirus discovered  Diagnostic tests  Present role of diagnostic tests  A role out for other emergencies (influenza pandemic, bioterrorism)  Why SARS is such a serious threat  Chronology of events  Lessons: the value of innovation and international collaboration   Status of the global SARS outbreak and lessons for the immediate future David L. Heymann Executive Director, Communicable Diseases, WHO    Current status of the SARS outbreak At this moment, public health authorities, physicians and scientists around the world are struggling to cope with a severe and rapidly spreading new disease in humans, severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS. This appears to be the first severe and easily transmissible new disease to emerge in the 21st century. Though much about the disease remains poorly understood, including the exact identity of the causative virus, we do know that it has features that allow it to spread rapidly along international air travel routes.   As of 10 April, 2781 SARS cases, with 111 deaths, have been reported to WHO from 17 countries on three continents. Some outbreaks have reassuring features. A high awareness of SARS symptoms among travellers and the medical and nursing professions has often resulted in good management of imported cases – prompt isolation of patients and management according to strict procedures of infection control. As a result, many countries having only a single or a few imported cases have experienced no further spread to hospital staff, families of patients and hospital visitors, or the community at large.   The list of countries and continents reporting suspect or probable SARS cases will no doubt continue to grow due to heightened global vigilance, knowledge about symptoms and exposures, and awareness of the need for immediate isolation of cases and strict infection control. So long as these measures are followed, the detection of first cases in countries need not be interpreted as evidence that SARS is continuing to spread. Tabular information on countries reporting SARS and the cumulative total of cases and deaths is published each day on the WHO SARS web site.   “Hot zones” of concern Despite some positive signs that imported cases are not spreading further, outbreaks in China, Canada, Hong Kong, Hanoi, and Singapore have taken root in hospitals and beyond, and give rise to considerable concern. One of the most alarming features of SARS in these areas is its rapid spread in hospitals, where it has affected a large number of previously healthy health care workers. Many require intensive care, placing a huge strain on hospital facilities and staff. In countries, such as Canada, where cases occurred before WHO issued its global alert, SARS is continuing to spread despite the introduction of strict patient isolation and excellent infection control.   China On 9 April, a WHO investigative team, which had conducted interviews and studies in Guangdong Province since 3 April, presented its interim report on the SARS outbreak to Chinese authorities. The team concluded that the health system in Guangdong responded well to the outbreak, but that health systems in all other provinces had less capacity to cope with the severity of the challenge posed by SARS. Several recommendations for improvements were made in the report.   The team also found evidence of “super-spreaders” in Guangdong, including one who is thought to have infected as many as 100 other persons. The outbreak is now thought to date back to at least 16 November, when an initial case was reported in Foshan City.   Particular concern centres on the situation in Beijing. Yesterday, WHO deepened discussions with Beijing health authorities, particularly concerning the efficiency of systems for case reporting and contact tracing.   Canada To date, Canada has reported 114 probable cases and 10 deaths. All cases have occurred in persons who have travelled to Asia or had close contact with SARS cases in households or health care facilities. Health Canada has taken several steps to protect the health of Canadians and the travelling public, and to reduce opportunities of transmitting the virus to others. Several Canadian schools and hospitals are closed.   Hong Kong Hong Kong, with 998 cases and 30 deaths, is presently the hardest hit area. Health care workers continue to become infected in a growing number of hospitals. WHO learned this week that the chief executive of the Prince of Wales Hospital – the initial epicentre of the Hong Kong outbreak – is hospitalized with atypical pneumonia. Hospitals are becoming overwhelmed. A decision to suspend all primary, secondary, special schools and kindergartens until 6 April has been extended up to 21 April.   Most disturbing is a large cluster of 268 SARS cases linked to the Amoy Gardens estate of high-rise apartment buildings. The vast majority of Amoy Gardens cases have been traced to vertically linked apartments in a single building, Block E. This pattern of transmission indicates that the disease has moved out of the health care setting and is now occurring within the community as secondary cases. Epidemiologists investigating the Amoy Gardens outbreak are considering the hypothesis that some form of environmental contamination, perhaps linked to a sewage or ventilation system, is the source of the large cluster of cases. Although transmission through the faecal-oral route is being considered as one possibility, no evidence of airborne transmission has been demonstrated to date. Virus has not been detected in animals, including cockroaches and rodents.   Yesterday, health authorities in Hong Kong announced that all household contacts of confirmed SARS patients will be required to confine themselves at home for up to 10 days with immediate effect. Household contacts can choose between confinement in their homes and confinement in holiday camps. No visitors are allowed during the confinement period, and permission to leave homes or camps will be granted only on exceptional grounds. During the confinement period, the Hong Kong Department of Health will conduct medical checks to monitor health, and the police force will conduct compliance checks.   Viet Nam In Viet Nam, an epidemiologist from the Hanoi WHO office recognized the first case of SARS on 28 February at a French hospital in Hanoi. The number of cases increased rapidly but then stabilized on 24 March at 58 cases and remained stable for 8 consecutive days. As the maximum incubation period for SARS is thought to be 10 days, the stable number of cases over this period raised hope that Viet Nam’s outbreak had been brought under control. However, on 3 April a probable SARS case was detected in a provincial hospital. Though the case could be linked back to the French hospital, the absence of isolation and rigorous infection control at the provincial hospital suggests that many hospital staff, patients, and visitors may have been exposed, thus possibly seeding further waves of cases. An additional three probable cases, both known to have had close contacts with cases, have been reported since 3 April.   Singapore In Singapore, another of the earliest and hardest hit areas, 126 persons, including several children under the age of 18 years, have been diagnosed with SARS. Most disturbing are new and large clusters of suspected SARS cases among health workers, inpatients, and visitors in two interlinked wards at Singapore General Hospital and in a second hospital, Tan Tok Seng Hospital.   Intense contact tracing and investigation of these clusters increasingly points to contact with a single Chinese man in his 60s who was treated at Singapore General Hospital from 5 to 20 March for chronic kidney disease and diabetes at Singapore General Hospital. WHO epidemiologists, in collaboration with national authorities, are finding increasing evidence that the Chinese patient might have been a so-called “super-spreader.”   In SARS outbreaks, a “super-spreader” is a source case who has, for as yet unknown reasons, infected a large number of persons. It remains unknown whether such “super-spreaders” are persons secreting an exceptionally high amount of infectious material or whether some other factor, perhaps in the environment, is working to amplify transmission at some key phase of virus shedding.   New coronavirus discovered Through new mechanisms set up by WHO, progress on the research front has been unprecedented, particularly in the rapid discovery of a new coronavirus and the rapid development of diagnostic tests. The best scientists from around the world are working on these problems around the clock, and in an unprecedented spirit of collaboration against a threat of, as yet, unknown dimensions. Nonetheless, we still do not have conclusive proof that the new virus is indeed the cause of SARS. The results of animal experiments, which are currently being conducted by a laboratory in a WHO network , will be available soon and may provide the last pieces of evidence needed for definitive proof that SARS is caused by the newly discovered coronavirus. Furthermore, the findings will provide additional evidence to understand the role of metapneumovirus as a possible “helper virus” in persons co-infected with the new coronavirus.   Diagnostic tests The development of a diagnostic test has proved more problematic than hoped. Three tests are now available and are helping to improve understanding of how the virus causes disease in humans. However, all three tests have limitations as tools for bringing the SARS outbreak quickly under control.   The ELISA detects antibodies reliably but only from about day 20 after the onset of clinical symptoms. It therefore cannot be used to detect cases at an early stage before they have a chance to spread the infection to others.   The second test, an immunofluorescence assay (IFA), detects antibodies reliably as of day 10 of infection, but is a comparatively slow test that requires the growth of virus in cell culture.   The presently available PCR molecular test for detection of SARS virus genetic material is useful in the early stages of infection but produces many false-negatives. This means that many persons who actually carry the virus may not be detected – creating a dangerous sense of false security for a virus that is known to spread easily in close person-to-person contact.   Present role of tests in diagnosis A positive test results indicates that a person is, or recently was, infected with the coronavirus. However, a negative test result does not guarantee that the person is not infected with the virus.   At present, reporting to WHO of probable SARS cases is based on an assessment of clinical symptoms, history – including travel history – of possible exposure to an infected person, and distinctive chest X-rays. The nine countries in the WHO laboratory network, namely Canada, France, Germany, Japan, Hong Kong SAR, the Netherlands, Singapore, the United Kingdom, and the United States of America, are beginning to conduct routine laboratory testing of suspect and probable SARS cases. WHO has posted on its web site details about the test methodology that allows other countries to perform tests. However, more work is needed to produce a robust test that is capable rapidly and reliably detecting cases at an early stage of infection.   SARS response: a roll out for other emergencies caused by infectious diseases Apart from the dimensions of the SARS outbreak apparent at this date, the sections below explain why this disease poses a particularly severe threat to international health, outline the chronology of events as SARS spread around the world, and discuss lessons, based on strengths and weaknesses of the global response, for the immediate future. These lessons are of great importance.   The SARS response is the roll out of a global alert and response activity under the revision of the International Health Regulations, which provide the legal framework for the surveillance and reporting of infectious disease and for the use of measures to prevent their international spread. SARS is showing how the alert and response activity works in practice for a newly identified disease. It also indicates how the system now in operation could apply to other highly significant infectious disease events, including the next influenza pandemic, the next emerging infection, and the deliberate release of a biological agent in an act of warfare or terrorism. The scientific community is now contending with an outbreak caused by a new virus. This creates an extra step in the containment response: identification and characterization of the causative agent, which then allows development of a diagnostic test, treatment protocols, and a scientifically sound basis for recommending control measures. This is a step that would not be needed should a biological attack occur using a well-known pathogen such as anthrax or smallpox. The response to an influenza pandemic would likewise not be dealing with an entirely new and poorly understood virus.   SARS: a particularly serious threat to international health Although the last decades of the previous century witnessed the emergence of several new diseases, SARS needs to be regarded as a particularly serious threat for several reasons. If the SARS virus maintains its present pathogenicity and transmissibility, SARS could become the first severe new disease of the 21st century with global epidemic potential. As such, its clinical and epidemiological features, though poorly understood, give cause for particular alarm. With the notable exception of AIDS, most new diseases that emerged during the last two decades of the previous century or established endemicity in new geographical areas have features that limit their capacity to pose a major threat to international public health. Many (avian influenza, Nipah virus, Hendra virus, Haanta virus) failed to establish efficient human-to-human transmission. Others (Escherichia coli O157:H7, variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease) depend on food as a vehicle of transmission. Diseases such as West Nile Fever and Rift Valley Fever that have spread to new geographical areas require a vector as part of the transmission cycle and are associated with low mortality, often in high-risk groups, such as the elderly, the immunocompromised, or persons with co-morbidity. Still others (Neisseria meningitidis W135, and the Ebola, Marburg, and Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fevers) have strong geographical foci. Although outbreaks of Ebola haemorrhagic fever have been associated with case-fatality rates in the range of 53% (Uganda) to 88% (Democratic Republic of the Congo), person-to-person transmission requires close physical exposure to infected blood and other bodily fluids. Moreover, patients suffering from this disease during the period of high infectivity are visibly very ill and too unwell to travel.   In contrast, SARS is emerging in ways that suggest great potential for rapid international spread under the favourable conditions created by a highly mobile, closely interconnected world. Anecdotal data indicate an incubation period of 2 to 10 days (average 2 to 7 days), allowing the infectious agent to be transported, unsuspected and undetected, in a symptomless air traveller from one city in the world to any other city having an international airport. Person-to-person transmission through close contact with respiratory secretions has been demonstrated. The initial symptoms are non-specific and common. The concentration of cases in previously healthy hospital staff and the proportion of patients requiring intensive care are particularly alarming. This “21st century” disease could have other consequences as well. Should SARS continue to spread, the global economic consequences – alreadyestimated at around US$ 30 billion – could be great in a closely interconnected and interdependent world.   Chronology of events leading to an unprecedented emergency travel advisory Severe Acute Pulmonary Syndrome (SARS) was first identified in Viet Nam on 28 February, 2003, when Dr Carlo Urbani, an epidemiologist from the Hanoi WHO office examined a patient with a severe form of pneumonia for which no etiology could be found. On 10 March 2003, 22 hospital workers in Hanoi French Hospital were ill with a similar acute respiratory syndrome, and by 11 March similar outbreaks had been reported among hospital workers in Hong Kong.   SARS occurred at a time of heightened surveillance for atypical respiratory disease. From 10 February the WHO office in Beijing, which reinforced its staff with two epidemiologists, had been working with the government of China to learn more about an outbreak of atypical respiratory disease that affected health workers, their families and contacts in Guandong Province, with 305 cases and 5 deaths reported from 16 November 2002 to 7 February 2003. Around 30% of cases were reported to occur in health care workers. Surveillance was heightened further when a 33-year-old man who had travelled with his family to Fujian Province in China died in Hong Kong on 17 February. The next day, Hong Kong authorities announced that avian influenza A(H5N1) virus, the cause of “bird flu”, had been isolated from both the man and his nine-year-old hospitalized son. Another member of the family, an eight-year-old daughter, died while in Fujian and was buried there.   On 12 March, after an assessment of the situation in Asia with WHO teams in Hanoi, Hong Kong and Beijing, a global alert was issued about cases of severe atypical pneumonia with unknown etiology that appeared to place health workers at high risk.   Two days later, on 14 March, WHO received a report from the government of Canada that health authorities had taken steps to alert hospital workers, ambulance services, and public health units across the provinces that there were four cases of atypical pneumonia within a single family in Toronto that had resulted in 2 deaths. At 02h00 Geneva time on the following day, 15 March, the government of Singapore notified WHO, by urgent telecommunication, of a similar illness in a 32-year-old physician who had treated hospital workers with a severe respiratory syndrome in Singapore, including one from the French Hanoi hospital who had self-evacuated to Singapore. This Singapore physician had travelled to the United States for a medical conference, and at the end of the conference boarded a return flight to Singapore in New York. Before departure he had indicated to a colleague in Singapore by telephone that he had symptoms similar to the patients he had treated in Singapore. The colleague notified health authorities. WHO identified the airline and flight, and the physician and his accompanying family members were removed from the flight at a stopover in Frankfurt, Germany, where he was immediately isolated and placed under hospital care, as were his two accompanying family members when they developed fever and respiratory symptoms several days later. As a result of this prompt action, Germany experienced no further spread linked to the three imported cases.   Later in the morning of 15 March, with this background and chronology of events, a decision was made by WHO to increase the level of the global alert issued on 12 March. The decision was based on five different but related factors. First, the etiology, and therefore the potential for continued spread, of this new disease were not yet known. Second, the outbreaks appeared to pose a great risk to health workers who managed patients, and to the family members and other close contacts of patients. Third, many different antibiotics and antivirals had been tried empirically and did not seem to have an effect. Fourth, though the numbers were initially small, a significant percentage of patients (25 of 26 hospital staff in Hanoi, and 24 of 39 hospital staff in Hong Kong) had rapidly progressed to respiratory failure, requiring intensive care and causing some deaths in previously healthy persons. Finally, the disease had moved out of its initial focus in Asia and appeared to have spread to North America and Europe.   At this time, the epidemiology of SARS was poorly understood. A virulent strain of influenza had not been ruled out as a possible cause, even though transmission patterns were not characteristic for influenza. There was also some hope that the new disease, like many other new diseases of the recent past, would fail to maintain efficient person-to-person transmission, or that it might attenuate with passage and eventually self-contain. Despite the lack of understanding about the disease, its cause, and future evolution, the need was great to introduce a series of emergency measures to contain SARS outbreaks in the affected areas and prevent further international spread, thus reducing opportunities for the new disease to establish endemicity. WHO thus decided, on 15 March, to issue a rare emergency travel advisory as a global alert to international travellers, health care professionals, and health authorities.   The global alert called for increased attention to patients with atypical pneumonia who fit the following case definition:   – High fever (>38 C) – One or more respiratory symptoms including cough, shortness of breath, difficulty breathing AND One or more of the following: – Close contact with a person who has been diagnosed with SARS – Recent history of travel to areas reporting cases of SARS.   At the same time the global alert recommended no change in patterns of international travel, but that passengers notify their health authority if they should develop signs and symptoms as described above and have a history of travel to areas reporting cases of SARS. Following this alert, awareness increased immediately, and many potential new outbreaks were prevented by the prompt isolation and strict management of suspected cases.   By 27 March, however, it was evident that international spread of SARS had continued after the 15 March advisory at two of the earliest outbreak sites, namely Viet Nam and Hong Kong, and that persons on the same aeroplanes as persons with symptoms consistent with SARS, and sitting in close proximity to them, had developed signs and symptoms compatible with SARS. On this date it was decided to recommend new measures related to international travel, still with the intent of preventing the international spread of the infectious agent. These recommendations were that SARS-affected areas, where transmission was known to be occurring in chains of human-to-human transmission, institute measures to identify international passengers who had signs, symptoms and history compatible with SARS, and to recommend that such persons postpone international travel and seek medical advice. These recommendations were instituted in most of the affected areas shortly after 27 March   However, concern continued to mount. An urgent investigation of the Amoy Gardens outbreak in Hong Kong began on 29 March, and the following day, health officials announced that 213 Amoy residents were probable cases of SARS. This followed an unusual cluster of cases, closely linked in time and place, among guests and visitors who had stayed on the same floor of a hotel located in the same district (Kowloon) as Amoy Gardens. By this same date, 9 business travellers and tourists had returned to Singapore, Beijing and Taiwan from Hong Kong, either sick or in the incubation period of SARS.   Outbreaks in the hotel and housing estate indicated that SARS was showing an unusual pattern of transmission in Hong Kong, probably involving an environmental component, that would place persons at risk outside the confined health care settings associated with outbreaks in most other countries. The 9 cases of probable SARS that occurred in Singapore, Beijing, and Taiwan, and that were associated with travel in Hong Kong, indicated that the risk of international spread was continuing. Consultations were made with WHO teams and travel experts. On 2 April a recommendation for voluntary postponement of all but essential travel was issued for travellers considering travel to Hong Kong. At the same time, because the WHO team and government of China had confirmed that the 4-month long outbreak in Guangdong continued, and that cases fit the case definition being applied in Viet Nam and Hong Kong; and because transmission patterns in Guangdong were not yet available, these same recommendations were made for Guangdong as maximum security against spread of SARS outside of Guangdong in the absence of complete understanding of transmission patterns of the outbreak there.   Cases of possible transmission in aeroplanes continue to be reported and investigated. As recently as 5 April, notification of a SARS patient travelling internationally by sea from Hong Kong to Vladivostak (Russian Federation) was received, opening a possible second route of international travel for the virus.   WHO travel recommendations are kept under constant review and will be amended as more data about the evolution of SARS become available.   Lessons: the value of innovation and international collaboration The knowledge obtained in the three-week period since 15 March has been remarkable. It demonstrates the value of international cooperation on emerging infections and the importance of early detection and rapid introduction of emergency measures to prevent further international spread and help ensure that imported cases are not allowed to cause disease in others.   When WHO began to set up emergency plans on 15 March, identification of the SARS causative agent and the development of a diagnostic test were given paramount importance in the overall containment strategy. Detection of the disease in its early stage, confirmation of cases, understanding modes of transmission, development of protocols for targeted treatment, vaccine research and development, and implementation of disease-specific preventive measures would all depend upon swift progress and results in etiological and diagnostic research. Sound public health measures would also require understanding of the presence and concentration of the pathogen in different tissues and secretions, and patterns of excretion throughout the course of illness and convalescence. So long as the aetiological agent remained unknown, specialists in infectious disease control would be forced to resort to control tools dating back to the “Middle Ages” of microbiology: isolation and quarantine.   On 17 March, a network of 11 leading laboratories around the world was set up as a mechanism for expediting identification of the SARS causative agent. Laboratories were selected on the basis of three criteria: outstanding scientific expertise, facilities at biosafety level III, and capacity to contribute to the battery of tests and experiments that would be needed to fulfill Koch's four postulates for the identification of an infectious agent as the cause of a specific disease. The network was set up on the model of the influenza network and provides another important lesson: models and systems set up for one health emergency can be rapidly adapted to serve others.   Collaboration is virtual. Members of the network confer in daily teleconferences coordinated by WHO, and use a secure web site to post electron microscopic pictures of candidate viruses, sequences of genetic material for virus identification and characterization, descriptions of experiments, and results. The well-guarded secret techniques that give each laboratory its competitive edge have been immediately and openly shared with others. Laboratories also quickly exchange various samples from patients and postmortem tissues. These arrangements have allowed the analysis of samples from the same patient simultaneously in several laboratories specialized in different approaches, with the results shared in real time. This collaboration has resulted in the identification of the suspected causative agent, and the development of three diagnostic tests, with unprecedented speed.   Virus isolation continues from patients with SARS, and at the same time virus has been isolated from tears and faeces. Publications on these various findings are being prepared by members of this collaborating group, but the need remains for a highly sensitive and specific PCR test to diagnose acute infections.   A similar collaborative group on epidemiology, made up of investigators from all sites with local transmission of SARS, continues to confirm person-to-person transmission as the major route of transmission. Today, the group exchanged information about the Hong Kong investigations to identify a possible environmental source, which might prove useful in understanding the unusual new cluster of cases in Singapore. Key questions include the exact points during the course of incubation and infection when transmission occurs and whether asymptotic cases are also capable of spreading SARS. These questions must be answered to better evaluate the extent of spread of SARS, and the success of containment activities.   A third clinical group, which unites 80 clinicians from 13 countries having SARS cases, has consistently provided anecdotal information about the lack of efficacy of treatment with specific antibiotics and antivirals, and has begun to develop systematic clinical trials of Ribaviran at two sites. Their discussions have shed light on features of the disease at presentation, treatment and progression of the disease, prognostic indicators, and discharge criteria. No therapy has been shown to demonstrate any particular effectiveness. The clinicians agreed that a subset of SARS patients, perhaps 10%, decline, usually around day 7, and need mechanical assistance to breathe. The care of these people is often complicated by the presence of other diseases. In this group, mortality is high. Age over 40 years also appears to be associated with a more severe form of disease. Countries have made travel recommendations for their citizens, using the guidance provided by WHO and other considerations such as feasibility of medical evacuation of their citizens and their insurance coverage should they become infected.   On 28 March, at the end of the second week of the global response, China, an initially reluctant partner in the global alert and response at the start, became a full partner in the three working groups that were studying SARS, and concluded that the outbreaks of SARS elsewhere in Asia were related to the outbreak in Guangdong Province. The Chinese government has announced that SARS is being given top priority. A system of alert and response for all emerging and epidemic-prone diseases is being developed. Daily electronic reporting of new cases and deaths, by province, has begun. Equally important, health officials have begun daily televised press conferences, thus taking the important step of increasing the awareness of the population and hospital staff of the characteristic symptoms, the need to seek prompt medical attention, and the need to manage patients according to the principles of isolation and strict infection control.   The next weeks and months will tell whether the global alert and response will contain the current SARS outbreaks, preventing SARS from becoming yet another endemic infectious disease in human populations, or whether SARS will remain confined to its origins in nature, to re-emerge at yet another time and place. It is clear that the responsibility for containing the emergence of any new infectious disease showing international spread lies on all countries. In a world where all national borders are porous when confronted by a microbial threat, it is in the interest of all populations for countries to share the information they may have as soon as it is available. In so doing, they will allow both near and distant countries – all neighbours in our globalized world – to benefit from the understanding they have gained.  "
"2003","http://www.who.int/csr/don/2003_04_10/en/index.html"," Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) -  multi-country outbreak - Update 26  Status of SARS outbreaks in individual countries   10 April 2003 Disease Outbreak Reported   China WHO is now planning to deepen discussions with health authorities in Beijing. This action follows concerns, connected with yesterday’s report from a WHO investigative team, about SARS cases in Beijing and systems of case reporting and contact tracing.   China is today reporting 10 new SARS cases, with 2 new deaths, compared with yesterday.   In a separate development, two laboratories in China have announced detection of a coronavirus in specimens taken from SARS patients. The new virus, which is unlike any known human or animal virus in the coronavirus family, was isolated by a WHO virtual network of 11 laboratories set up to expedite identification of the etiological agent and development of a diagnostic test. Detection of the coronavirus adds further evidence that the outbreak that began in Guangdong Province in mid-November 2002 was caused by the SARS virus.   Hong Kong Health authorities in Hong Kong have today announced that all household contacts of confirmed SARS patients will be required to confine themselves at home for up to 10 days with immediate effect. The new measure is intended to facilitate early detection and treatment of SARS cases and to reduce to the absolute minimum the risk of further spread. With a cumulative total of 998 cases and 28 deaths, Hong Kong ranks just below China in the severity of the SARS outbreak.   Household contacts can choose between confinement in their homes and confinement in holiday camps. No visitors are allowed during the confinement period, and permission to leave homes or camps will be granted only on exceptional grounds.   During the confinement period, the Hong Kong Department of Health will conduct medical checks to monitor health, and the police force will conduct compliance checks.   Officials in the Department of Health estimate that an initial 70 to 80 households, representing around 150 persons, will be subject to the new requirement.   In a separate development, ongoing investigations of the source of infection in the unusual cluster of cases in Amoy Gardens have failed to detect the virus in animals. The findings refute previous hypotheses that the SARS might have been spread by cockroaches or rodents, possibly through some common system serving vertically connected flats. Most Amoy Gardens cases have been residents in a single wing of a single building, Block E.   Singapore In Singapore, particular concern has centered on a cluster of suspect and probable SARS cases first noted on 5 April in 21 staff at the Singapore General Hospital. Intensive investigation by WHO staff and Ministry of Health officials have traced most cases to a single Chinese man in his 60s was had been treated for chronic kidney disease and diabetes at another hospital (Tan Tock Hospital) from 5 to 20 March. The hospital subsequently experienced a cluster of 19 probable and 33 suspected SARS cases in staff, visitors, and inpatients. Most have been linked to the Chinese patient.   The second hospital-related cluster of SARS cases has now been linked to a decision to transfer all patients at Singapore General Hospital to two wards at Tan Tock Seng Hospital. It is strongly suspected that the second cluster arose from contact with the Chinese patient. The investigation is providing some reassurance about the cause of these cases, which increasingly appear to fit the known pattern of exposure during close contact with patients.   Viet Nam The number of cases in Viet Nam remains stable at 62. WHO staff and Ministry of Health officials anticipate that additional cases, associated with a case in a provincial hospital, may emerge in the next few days. However, vigilance is high, contact tracing is intense, and good infection control procedures are in place.   Canada Health Canada has reported a cumulative total of 97 cases, with 10 deaths. The represents an increase of only 3 new cases for the second consecutive day. Ontario has reported 94 probable cases. All cases have occurred in persons who have travelled to Asia or had contact with SARS cases in the household or in a health-care setting. British Columbia has reported 3 probable cases.   Malaysia: history of third probable case WHO staff are collaborating with health authorities in Malaysia to conduct in-depth investigations, including history of recent travel and visits to health facilities, of the country’s three probable SARS cases in an effort to prevent a wider outbreak. Two new cases were reported today. Investigation of the country’s third case has revealed a history of travel to Beijing, China and Bangkok, Thailand. Onset of illness occurred in Bangkok. Upon return to Penang, Malaysia, the patient visited two private hospitals over a two-day period. Possible contacts are now being traced.   Active contact tracing is a sound and essential public health measure for detecting persons who may have been exposed and alerting them to the steps to take should symptoms develop. Contact tracing can also establish whether all probable patients and suspect cases are linked together, through close face-to-face contact, and thus determine whether any instance of secondary transmission in the general community has occurred.   Update on cases and countries As of today, a cumulative total of 2781 cases and 111 deaths have been reported from 17 countries. Increases occurred in Brazil (1), Canada (3), China (10), Hong Kong SAR (28), Germany (1), Malaysia (2), Singapore (8), and the United States (5). Deaths were reported in China (2) and Hong Kong SAR (3).  "
"2003","http://www.who.int/csr/don/2003_04_09/en/index.html"," Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) -  multi-country outbreak - Update 25  Interim report of WHO team in China, status of the main SARS outbreaks in different countries   9 April 2003 Disease Outbreak Reported  China The WHO team of experts presented its interim report on the SARS outbreak in Guangdong Province this morning to the Chinese Ministry of Health and Vice Premier Wu Yi in Beijing. The team began its investigations in Guangdong on 3 April.   The team concluded that the health system in Guangdong responded well to the outbreak. The province has a health system in which every hospital at every level reports any new cases of SARS. The WHO report therefore concluded that virtually all probable cases of SARS presenting at a hospital in Guangdong Province will be detected and rapidly reported.   However, the team found an urgent need to improve surveillance in the countryside to head off new outbreaks in rural areas. The team was further concerned by an increase in sporadic cases, which could not be linked to a particular transmission chain, as such cases raised questions about the adequacy of contact tracing.   In addition, the report noted many remaining concerns about the ability of other provinces, where health systems are not as strong as the one in Guangdong, to respond promptly and effectively to the challenge of SARS.   In Beijing, for example, only a minority of hospitals make daily reports of SARS cases. Contact tracing is another problem in Beijing and does not appear to be carried out systematically. Failure to perform careful contact tracing will allow the disease to spread.   The team observed that many of China’s poorer provinces may not have adequate resources, facilities, and equipment to cope with outbreaks of SARS, and underscored that Guangdong’s capacity was exceptional among China’s provinces.   In Guangdong, the SARS outbreak placed an enormous strain on the health care system. The Guangdong Infectious Disease Hospital (Guangzhou No. 8 People’s Hospital) had 150 of its 400 beds occupied by SARS patients daily during the second week of February. The team noted that the response of the health care system has been exemplary, and commended the dedication and bravery of doctors, nurses, and others working in clinics and hospitals.   Microbiological findings  Large banks of stored specimens from suspected and probable SARS cases, from case contacts as well as from “normal controls” exist at the institutions visited and are stored under suitable conditions; detailed information about the numbers and types of these specimens are available and were provided to members of the WHO team. Although the patient data on each of these is very limited, it is sufficient to allow linkage with the very detailed epidemiological and clinical informations held elsewhere in Guangdong Provincial Centers for Disease Control and the hospitals.   These specimen banks comprise different types of respiratory specimens from which the detection of agents can be attempted and serum samples, often as paired acute and convalescent sera (i.e. the first sample obtained during the acute phase of the illness and the second during recovery) which will allow determination of seroconversions. The laboratory staff agreed that once a causative agent for SARS was identified these banks should be tested and will provide very valuable information; they seemed, however, less sure whether this time had come already, i.e. whether there was already sufficient evidence and whether suitable tests had been developed elsewhere that would make such an exercise worthwhile. They requested assistance from the WHO team to obtain relevant information on primer sequences and other matters as well as access to suitable experimental tests such as immunofluorescence antibody assays.   Main recommendations The interim report made several major recommendations, including the following: - The SARS reporting system established in Guangdong is an excellent model that all provinces should follow. Team members suggest that the MOH ensures that all provinces are brought up to Guangdong standards by implementing this system nationwide as a matter of the utmost urgency. A programme for evaluating and accrediting surveillance systems through evaluation by technical experts is also suggested in order to ensure that consistent standards are achieved and maintained. - The Guangdong experience should be used to develop uniform standards throughout all provinces for preventing the spread of SARS in health care facilities. - Careful contact tracing of SARS cases is vital to bring the outbreak under control. Detailed interviewing of all newly reported SARS cases by trained interviewers including a full review not only of close contacts but potential exposure in other crowded settings, e.g. public transport needs to be routinely carried out Contacts of cases should be provided with detailed preventive advice verbally and in writing. - Much better collaboration between virological laboratories in China is required, particularly to facilitate the exchange of results, specimens and reagents. The following institutions should form the nucleus of a national SARS laboratory network within China:    · National Institute of Virology, China CDC, Beijing    · Virology Unit, Beijing Provincial CDC, Beijing    · Virology Unit, Guangdong Provincial CDC, Guangzhou    · Department of Virology, Zhongshan University, Guangzhou Laboratories from other areas with experience of SARS cases should also be included. Adequate funding and human resources need to be urgently provided to ensure the proper functioning and sustainability of SARS surveillance activities as they are essential to controlling spread of the disease. Chinese institutions should form a national SARS laboratory network within China to speed up the exchange of results, specimens and reagents.   - Guangdong clinicians have cared for the largest number of patients in the world and their experience should be shared with the international community through publications, meetings and in drafting guidelines for the management of SARS patients.   Priority actions Priority actions recommended in the report to contain SARS include: - early recognition and treatment of cases - stringent infection control measures in hospitals and clinics - prompt reporting of suspected cases - meticulous investigation and contact tracing in the community - public awareness campaigns and education.   Hong Kong: heavy burden on the health system With today’s cumulative total of 970 cases and 27 deaths, Hong Kong continues to have the largest SARS outbreak, second to China. The strain on health services and staff is considerable, and strengthened measures of infection control may be needed.   The isolation order placed on Block E, Amory Gardens will expire at midnight, April 9. The Hong Kong Health Department has announced that residents, temporarily housed at camps, may return home after their flats have been disinfected by the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department.   Singapore: role of “super-spreaders” Singapore has increased measures to prevent transmission in hospitals following an outbreak in Singapore General Hospital. Measures include mandatory temperature checks for all staff, limiting visitors, and isolation of all possible SARS cases. The Singapore General Hospital outbreak involved over 20 people with suspect symptoms, nearly all nurses and doctors. Only seven have been diagnosed as “probable” SARS cases. The distribution of cases over time suggests a point source. The health worker considered to be the index case in this cluster of cases may be the fourth “super-spreader” identified in Singapore.   A “super-spreader” is a source case who has, for as yet unknown reasons, infected a large number of persons. Although transmission patterns of SARS remain incompletely understood, evidence suggests that such “super-spreaders” may have contributed to the evolution of SARS outbreaks around the world.   Until recently, all cases in Singapore have had good epidemiological links to their source. Further work is now required to establish similar links for the more recent cases. If confirmed, such linking of cases will show that transmission is limited to those who are symptomatic, and usually very ill. This hypothesis is supported by the observation that health workers continue to be the main group diagnosed with SARS. To date, investigation of the SARS outbreak in Singapore have revealed few signs of community spread beyond family members in close face-to-face contact with patients. However, these findings are based on limited data on exposures.   Viet Nam: no asymptomatic transmission Vietnam is now reporting a cumulative total of 62 cases. Four of these cases have been detected in the last few days following stable reporting of 58 cases for several consecutive days. The stable number of cases raised hope that the outbreak in the French hospital in Hanoi had been contained. However, a 59th case was reported on 31 March.   This male patient had been in contact with his daughter, who was a patient at the French Hospital at the time of Viet Nam’s index case. This contact continued when the daughter became an outpatient. The daughter’s husband, who attended the Hanoi French Hospital with his wife, had a mild febrile illness which was undiagnosed at the time and which resolved spontaneously. It is presumed that he had mild SARS and passed the infection to his father-in-law (case 59). Assuming this to be true, WHO epidemiologists maintain the view that asymptomatic transmission does not appear to occur. Nor does this case suggest a longer incubation period than currently assumed (2–7 days, with 10 days considered the rare maximum). Blood is being taken for testing of the husband. Case 60 is a doctor who cared for case 59 while he was in a provincial hospital about 1.5 hours from Hanoi. Cases 61 and 62 are young women who are part of the extended household who provided considerable care for case 59.   WHO continues to work with the Ministry of Health to investigate the contacts of these cases. It is anticipated that a few more new cases will be linked to case 59. Careful monitoring of contacts continues.   Of the 62 cases, 44 have been discharged, 4 have died and 14 remain in hospital. One of the hospitalized patients remains critically ill, although slightly improved. All other hospitalized patients are improving.   Canada: one new probable case reported Health Canada has reported a cumulative total of 94 probable cases and 10 deaths. Ontario has reported 91 probable cases. All cases have occurred in persons who have traveled to Asia or had contact with SARS cases in the household or in a health-care setting. The remaining probable cases are in British Columbia (3).   Update on cases and countries As of today, a cumulative total of 2722 cases, with 106 deaths have been reported from 16 countries. This represents an increase of 51 cases and 3 deaths when compared with yesterday.   New cases were reported in Canada (3), China (1), Hong Kong SAR (42), Singapore (5), and the United States of America (1). The single case reported in Australia has been removed from the list. Deaths were reported in Hong Kong (2) and Singapore (1).  "
"2003","http://www.who.int/csr/don/2003_04_08/en/index.html"," Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) - multi-country outbreak - Update 24  WHO Guangdong China team to issue its report   8 April 2003 Disease Outbreak Reported   The WHO expert team in Guangdong Province, China will be issuing its official interim report and recommendations on the local SARS situation early tomorrow. The four-person team, headed by John MacKenzie of Australia, has been in Guangdong since Thursday 3 April. The team was charged to assess the local situation and to support the strengthening of surveillance, clinical management, infection control, and laboratory evaluation of SARS cases.   The team has visited Foshan City, where the earliest case is thought to have occurred in mid-November 2002, and Guangzhou City, the provincial capital. In a wide ranging collaborative investigation, the team has met with authorities, health and veterinary professionals, and technical experts in the provincial Centers for Disease Control laboratories and the virology laboratories of Zongshan Medical University. The team has conferred with staff at all levels and been granted full access to all sites, institutes, and hospitals requested.   The team will be reporting on the provincial surveillance system, measures for community infection control, patient management and hospital infection control. It will also give a detailed review of microbiological findings.   The SARS outbreak in Guangdong Province is presently the largest and oldest known outbreak of SARS and may hold important clues about both the origins or the virus and measures for clinical management. In one of its earliest reports about cases of atypical pneumonia to WHO, the Chinese Ministry of Health reported 305 cases and 5 deaths, from mid-November to 9 February, in 6 municipalities: Foshan, Guangzhou, Heyuan, Jiangmen, Shenzhen, and Zhongshan.   Guangzhou was the home of a 64-year old professor of nephrology, at Zhongshan University, who is thought to be the index case who sparked the outbreak in Hong Kong. During late February, he stayed in room 911 on the ninth floor of the Metropole Hotel. Guests staying on the hotel’s ninth floor sparked outbreaks in other countries when they returned to their homes in Toronto and Singapore. A 48-year-old American businessman, who also stayed on the 9th floor, is believed to have originated the outbreaks in Hanoi and in Hong Kong’s Princess Margaret Hotel, where he was transferred. One local Hong Kong resident, who visited an acquaintance on the ninth floor, subsequently sparked an outbreak in a second Hong Kong hospital.   Elsewhere in China, Shanghai, which has reported its first SARS case, has requested a visit from the WHO team to discuss SARS and be advised on how best to deal with the disease.   In Beijing, the death on Sunday of a 53-year-old staff member of the International Labour Organization continued to cause considerable anxiety, particularly at embassies and among staff of international organizations. Epidemiologists at the WHO Office in Beijing have conducted contact tracing and other investigations to determine the source of the staff member’s exposure and to assess whether close contacts may have been exposed. To date, no SARS cases or suspicious symptoms related to this death have been observed. The investigations are continuing.   Update on cases and countries   As of today, 2671 SARS cases with 103 deaths have been reported from 17 countries. This represents an increase of 70 cases and 5 deaths when compared with yesterday. The new deaths were reported in Canada (1), Hong Kong SAR (2), and Singapore (2). The additional cases were reported in Canada (1), China (11), Hong Kong SAR (45), France (1), Singapore (7), and the United States (7). Taiwan, China removed 2 cases from the list.  "
"2003","http://www.who.int/csr/don/2003_04_07/en/index.html"," Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) - multi-country outbreak - Update 23  Status of the main SARS outbreaks in different countries   7 April 2003 Disease Outbreak Reported   China  The Chinese Ministry of Health is now providing daily updates on numbers of cases and deaths, nationwide by province. On 3 April, a total of 17 new cases, including two deaths, were reported. Two previously reported cases were excluded. Eleven new cases and one death occurred in Guangdong Province. One case was reported from Shanghai, four from Beijing, and one case (fatal) from Sichuan Province.   On April 4, 12 new cases, with no deaths, were reported, 11 from Guangdong and 1 from Shanxi. For April 5 and 6, 21 new cases and 2 new deaths were reported. The breakdown by province is awaiting translation from Chinese. This brings the total number of reported cases in China to 1268, with 53 deaths.   Chinese officials have announced that SARS is being made a high priority for the government. A system of alert and response for early detection and reporting of all emerging and epidemic-prone diseases is being put in place. The government has also begun holding daily press conferences. WHO welcomes this move, which is an important way to increase awareness of the population and health care staff of the characteristic symptoms, the need to seek prompt medical attention, and the need to manage patients according to the principles of isolation and strict infection control.   The WHO office in China has reported considerable anxiety among the international community following the death in Beijing on Sunday of a 53-year-old Finnish staff member of the International Labor Organization. The ILO staff members was in Beijing to attend an international conference. At present it is unclear how the staff member contracted SARS. He had travelled to Beijing via Thailand, where no local transmission has been reported.   Hong Kong  Hong Kong SAR continues to report the largest number of new cases, placing some hospitals under considerable strain. Today’s report from the Department of Health indicates that the unusual outbreak among residents in the Amoy Gardens estate, which has caused 268 cases, is coming to an end. Investigation of environmental samples continues at a rapid pace with support from several government departments. Evidence that the causative agent is excreted in faeces has focused attention on the possibility of an oral-faecal route of transmission, though no conclusions have been reached. Good data from the investigations are expected by the end of the week. The investigations have found no evidence of airborne spread.   Singapore  The Singapore Ministry of Health has reported an unusual cluster of 29 suspected SARS cases in hospital staff from two wards of a single hospital. Of these 4 are probable SARS cases. The onset of the clustering is believed to be 29 March. Officials investigating the cause of the outbreak are considering a possible point source in the environment, as it would be unusual for so many cases to begin on the same day if caused by contact with a patient   Viet Nam The outbreak in Viet Nam began at a French hospital in Hanoi, where the index case, a 48-year old Chinese-American businessman who worked for an import-export company in Hong Kong, was admitted on 26 February. The number of cases increased rapidly but then stabilized on 24 March at 58 cases and remained stable for 10 consecutive days. As the maximum incubation period for SARS is thought to be 10 days, the stable number of cases over this period raised hope that Viet Nam’s outbreak had been brought under control. However, on 3 April a probable SARS case was detected in a provincial hospital. Though the case could be linked back to the French hospital, the absence of isolation and rigorous infection control at the provincial hospital suggests that many hospital staff, patients, and visitors could have been exposed, thus possibly seeding further waves of cases. An additional three probable cases have been reported over the past two days.   Canada Health Canada has received reports of 217 probable or suspect cases of SARS. There have been 9 deaths in Canada. All Canadian cases have occurred in persons who have travelled to Asia or had contact with SARS cases in the household or in a health-care setting. The largest outbreak has occurred in Ontario, where 87 probable and 92 suspect cases have been reported. British Columbia is reporting 3 probable and 23 suspect cases, New Brunswick is reporting 2 suspect cases, Saskatchewan is reporting 1 suspect case, Alberta is reporting 5 suspect cases, and Prince Edward Island is reporting 4 suspect cases.   These reports account for the 90 probable cases included in the WHO cumulative table of cases and deaths for today.   Status of diagnostic tests The development of a diagnostic test, which is being pursued around the clock by the WHO collaborating network of 11 laboratories, has proved more problematic than hoped. Three diagnostic tests are now available and all have limitations as tools for bringing the SARS outbreak quickly under control.   The ELISA detects antibodies reliably but only from about day 20 after the onset of clinical symptoms. It therefore cannot be used to detect cases at an early stage before they have a chance to spread the infection to others. The second test, an immunofluorescence assay (IFA), detects antibodies reliably as of day 10 of infection, but is a demanding and comparatively slow test that requires the growth of virus in cell culture. The presently available PCR molecular test for detection of SARS virus genetic material is useful in the early stages of infection but produces many false-negatives, meaning that many persons who actually carry the virus may not be detected – creating a dangerous sense of false security for a virus that is known to spread easily in close person-to-person contact.   Update on cases and countries As of today, a cumulative total of 2601 cases of SARS, with 98 deaths, have been reported from 17 countries. This represents an increase of 85 cases and 9 deaths compared with the last update of 5 April. The deaths occurred in Canada (2), China (4), and Hong Kong SAR (3).   The single case reported in Belgium has been removed from the list.  "

The new data have been submitted as the start of daily electronic reports of cases and deaths nationwide, broken down by Province. Data submitted today report cases for 1 and 2 April and show an increase of 30 cases, with 3 deaths, when compared with the previous cumulative total for 31 March.   For 1 April, 10 cases, with 1 death, occurred in Guangdong Province, and 7 cases and no deaths were reported in Shanxi Province. For 2 April, 10 cases, with 1 death were reported in Guangdong Province, 2 cases and no deaths in Shanxi Province, and 1 case and 1 death in Hunan Province.   The new data increase the cumulative number of cases in China, up to 2 April, from 1190 to 1220 cases, and from 46 to 49 deaths.   Today’s table showing cumulative cases and deaths for all countries reporting suspected cases is being updated to reflect the new figures.   Update on cases and countries As of today and including the new data from China, a cumulative total of 2353 SARS cases and 84 deaths have been reported from 16 countries. This represents an increase of 83 cases and 5 deaths compared with yesterday. The deaths occurred in Canada (1), China (3), and Singapore (1).   New cases were reported in Canada (7), China (30), Hong Kong SAR (27), Taiwan, China (1), Singapore (2), and the United States of America (15).   Situation in Hong Kong SAR The Department of Health has reported that 27 additional patients with symptoms of atypical pneumonia were admitted to public hospitals today. The new patients include five health care workers and eight residents of the Amoy Gardens housing estate. The remaining 14 were new patients and contacts of patients with atypical pneumonia.   Of the 26 new patients reported yesterday, two were health care workers, two were residents of Amoy Gardens, and 22 were new patients and contacts of patients with atypical pneumonia. Health authorities are current investigating sewage samples at a construction site adjacent to Block E apartment building in Amoy Gardens, which has been the source of a large cluster of new SARS cases. New cases have been associated with vertically linked apartments. A second line of investigation is concentrating on a burst sewage pipe in block E that may have epidemiological links with a visitor to Amoy Gardens which was subsequently admitted to Hong Kong’s Prince of Wales Hospital in early March and was said to have been symptomatic at the time of his visit.

The team was authorized to travel to the province yesterday.   Meetings were held today with senior provincial health officials. The WHO team also listened to reports about the SARS outbreak, and held initial meetings with health workers at all levels. These workers, who have first-hand knowledge of the outbreak, include epidemiologists and clinicians treating SARS patients. Discussion focused on patterns of transmission, clinical profiles, and the suspected causative agent.   Chinese authorities had previously reported a cumulative total of 1153 cases and 40 deaths in Guangdong Province from 16 November, when the outbreak began, to the end of March, making this province the area most seriously affected by SARS to date.   The world’s first recognized case of SARS occurred in Guangdong Province on 16 November. Expectations are high that important clues will emerge concerning the origins of SARS, which is thought to be caused by a new virus in the coronavirus family. The exact identity of the virus has proved elusive. Scientists, who confer daily in teleconferences organized by WHO, currently speculate that the SARS virus either jumped to humans from an animal species or mutated into a more virulent form.   In its continuing work, the WHO team is expected to visit Foshan city, where the first case of SARS was reported, and Guangzhou city. The team will also visit health care facilities, review case records, and hold further discussions before returning to Beijing early next week.   In Beijing, the government of China is now gearing up to fight SARS on a priority basis. Reports in today’s media referred to a State Council executive meeting on SARS and described three key decisions.  A special task force, headed by Minister of Health Dr Zhang Wenkang, will take charge of the fight against SARS. A vice secretary-general of the State Council will coordinate actions by relevant ministries.  The task force will provide updates on SARS to WHO.  A nationwide mechanism for outbreak alert and response will be set up shortly to ensure rapid detection and reporting of outbreaks.   Dr Zhang appeared on Chinese national TV to address SARS-related issues.   Situation in Hong Kong SAR The Department of Health in Hong Kong SAR reported 26 new cases today, compared with 23 yesterday. These figures represent a significant decline from the 155 cases reported on Tuesday and 60 reported on Monday. This trend suggests that the extraordinary control measures undertaken by the government are working. The Department of Health further announced that 89 SARS patients have been discharged from hospitals.   Update on cases and countries As of today, a cumulative total of 2270 SARS cases and 79 deaths have been reported from 16 countries. This represents an increase of 47 cases and 1 death (in Hong Kong) compared with yesterday.   With the addition of the first probable case in Brazil, SARS is now being reported on four continents.   New cases were reported in Canada (4), Hong Kong (26), Taiwan, China (1), France (2), Singapore (3), the United States of America (13), and Viet Nam (1). Brazil reported their first probable case. Two of Romania’s three reported cases, one of the two cases in the Republic of Ireland, and the single case in Spain were removed from the list when determined to have other causes.  "

The figures, which cover the reporting period of 1 March to 31 March, are 361 new SARS cases and 9 deaths.   Chinese authorities had previously reported 792 cases and 31 deaths in Guangdong Province in the reporting period of 16 November 2002 to 28 February 2003. The cumulative total of SARS cases in Guangdong from 16 November to 31 March now stands at 1153 cases and 40 deaths.   The Chinese Ministry of Health has further announced that a five-person WHO team will be travelling immediately to Guangdong Province to confer with officials there. Chinese experience with the oldest SARS outbreak is expected to yield epidemiological and clinical clues useful in establishing policies to contain outbreaks elsewhere and prevent further international spread.   Many questions about the outbreak in Guangdong Province, which borders Hong Kong, have yet to be answered. This outbreak is the largest reported to date and has also shown evidence of spread in the wider community.   No transmission of new cases is being reported elsewhere in the country. Chinese authorities are in the process of setting up a reporting system that will result in daily real-time reporting of SAS cases throughout the country.   New advice to travellers On the basis of new data from China and Hong Kong, WHO has today revised its advice to international travellers as a measure for preventing the further international spread of SARS.   In a press release this morning, WHO issued the following advice:   “The World Health Organization (WHO) today began recommending that persons travelling to Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of China and Guangdong Province, China consider postponing all but essential travel. This updated travel advice comes as a result of new developments in the multi-country outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS).”   The new travel advice is intended to limit further international spread of SARS by restricting travel to areas where the transmission patterns of SARS are not fully understood. The SARS situation, which is rapidly evolving, is under constant assessment by WHO in collaboration with three global networks of experts. The new advice is issued as part of a series of measures that will change as more information about SARS becomes available.   New data on international spread Overnight, WHO received reports on 9 persons, with a history of travel to Hong Kong dating from 15 March, who subsequently developed symptoms suggesting probable cases of SARS when they travelled to other countries. These 9 cases of probable SARS, related to travel in Hong Kong, occurred in Taiwan, Province of China, and Singapore. The data on these cases, and what is known about the incubation period of SARS, indicate that travel to Hong Kong can contribute to the international spread of SARS.   15 March is the date when WHO issued its first SARS-related emergency travel advisory, which increased global awareness of this new disease, made travellers and health staff alert to symptoms, and initiated prompt reporting of cases.   The SARS outbreak in Hong Kong SAR has developed an unusual pattern of transmission. This pattern is different from what is being seen in the vast majority of other SARS outbreaks, and is not yet fully understood. The number of cases is continuing to increase significantly, and there is evidence that the disease has spread beyond the initial focus in hospitals.   These developments raise questions related to other routes of transmission, in addition to well-documented face-to-face exposure to droplets released when an infected person coughs or sneezes. Epidemiologists are considering whether SARS is being transmitted in Hong Kong by some environmental means for which no satisfactory explanation has been found.   Particular concern centres on a large cluster of cases linked to residential buildings in the Amoy Garden housing estate in the Kowloon district of Hong Kong.   Historical perspective This is the first time in the history of WHO that such travel advice has been issued for specific geographical areas because of an outbreak of an infectious disease.   Since 1958, WHO has issued weekly lists of areas infected with quarantinable diseases so that national authorities can decide whether to apply public health measures to arriving travellers. During the last years of the smallpox eradication campaign cases spread internationally by land. Controls at borders between neighbouring countries were relied on to prevent international spread. No global recommendations were necessary.  "

This updated travel advice comes as a result of new developments, particularly in Hong Kong, in the multi-country outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS).   This temporary recommendation will be reassessed daily as the epidemic evolves. The recommendation does not apply to passengers simply transiting through airports in Hong Kong Special Administrative Region or Guangdong Province, China.   The new travel advisory is intended to limit the spread of SARS by reducing travel to high risk areas. All other elements ofSevere Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) WHO previous travel guidance still stand. See Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS).   The SARS situation in Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, China has developed unique features. There is a continuing and significant increase in cases* with indications that SARS has spread beyond the initial focus in hospitals. These developments raise questions related to other possible routes of transmission of SARS. These may involve transport of the virus from one person to another via some type of environmental means. To date, no satisfactory explanation has been found regarding this possibility. Also, since March 19, nine travellers have been identified as SARS cases on returning from a visit to Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of China.   Many questions about the state of the outbreak in Guangdong Province, China which borders Hong Kong have yet to be answered. The Guangdong outbreak is the largest reported and has also shown evidence of spread in the wider community. New information provided today by provincial authorities of more than 300 new cases in March alone indicates the outbreak there continues.   Unprecedented global cooperation helps advance knowledge and containment of SARS   In the four weeks that WHO has been tracking SARS much has been learned. This is largely because scientists, clinicians, laboratory chiefs and public health officials everywhere have collaborated closely.   As a result of WHO's global alert issued on 15 March, national authorities have implemented heightened surveillance for cases of SARS. While an increasing number of countries are reporting new cases, these cases are quickly identified, patients are isolated and local transmission is stopped in most countries.   It is now known that infection control methods work to contain the spread of SARS in hospitals, even in countries which do not have the most modern equipment.   WHO and a network of 11 of the world's top laboratories are zeroing in on the cause of SARS and a diagnostic test is being developed. This test will help distinguish between those who are infected and those who are free of the SARS virus.   The laboratory network is continuing its investigations. So far, the agent causing SARS has not been fully characterized and there is no certain treatment, vaccine or known other preventative measure.    There will be other new diseases that will emerge in the future, and we will respond just as we have with SARS — with maximum efforts to contain its spread,  stated Dr Guénaël Rodier, Director, Communicable Disease Surveillance and Response, WHO.   * Cases of SARS and the countries in which they appear are posted on the WHO web site every evening in Geneva.

The agent causing SARS is under intensive international study, but as of today it has not been fully characterized, and there is no vaccine or other prophylaxis available.   Since WHO issued the global alert on the 12th of March national authorities have implemented heightened surveillance for cases of SARS and where such cases have been identified their prompt isolation has prevented further spread of the disease in virtually all countries. For instance the outbreak in Hanoi has passed its peak and no new cases have been identified for the last week. Last week WHO issued recommendations aimed at further limiting the spread of SARS and protecting international air passengers. These recommendations still apply (see WHO recommends new measures to prevent travel-related spread of SARS.)   The SARS situation in Hong Kong Special Administrative Region has developed features of concern: a continuing and significant increase in cases with indications that SARS has spread beyond the initial focus in hospitals. These developments have suggested environmental routes of transmission from a SARS infected person which may be related to contamination of common systems that link rooms or flats together. Despite the implementation of strict measures to control the outbreak, there have continued to be a small number of visitors to Hong Kong who have been identified as SARS cases after their return from Hong Kong. The epidemic in Guangdong Province of China, situated adjacent to Hong Kong, is the largest outbreak of SARS reported and has also shown evidence of spread in the wider community. As a measure of precaution WHO is now recommending that persons travelling to Hong Kong and Guangdong Province of China consider postponing non-essential travel. This temporary recommendation will be reassessed in the light of the evolution of the epidemic in the areas currently indicated, and other areas of the world could become subject to similar recommendations if the situation demands.   Please note that this recommendation applies only to travellers entering Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of China and Guangdong Province of China, not to passengers directly transiting through international airports within those areas.   * WHO has defined affected areas as an area in which local chain(s) of transmission of SARS is/are occurring as reported by the national public health authorities.

This represents an increase of 182 cases and 4 deaths compared with the previous day.   The largest increase occurred in Hong Kong, where 155 new cases were reported. This brings the cumulative total of cases in Hong Kong to 685 cases with 16 deaths.   Of the four new SARS deaths, three occurred in Hong Kong. The fourth death was reported in Singapore.   China remains the country with the largest number of cases. According to official reports, 806 cases with 34 deaths have occurred. The majority of these cases and deaths were associated with an outbreak in Guangdong Province. During that outbreak, authorities recorded 792 cases and 31 deaths from 16 November 2002 through 28 February.   Other countries reporting additional cases include Canada (9), Taiwan, China (3), Italy (1) Singapore (1), Thailand (1), and the United States of America (10). Australia and Belgium reported their first probable cases today.   In Viet Nam, where hospitals in Hanoi were among the earliest to experience a rapid burst of cases within a health care setting, the number of cases (58) and deaths (4) remained stable for the eighth day in a row. The incubation period for SARS is currently believed to range from two to 10 days. WHO epidemiologists regard an eight-day period with no newly detected cases as an encouraging sign that the outbreak in Hanoi has been controlled and that no further spread is occurring beyond the initial hospital foci.   Singapore, another country that was hard hit at the beginning of the epidemic, is likewise showing a stable pattern, with cases confined to well-documented risk groups and few new cases being detected.   An evolving epidemic SARS is a newly identified disease with transmission patterns that are only beginning to emerge and thus difficult to interpret. Much about the disease remains poorly understood, despite great progress in characterization of the causative virus and development of a robust diagnostic test.   Particularly puzzling are the great differences between areas where outbreaks appear to have been fairly rapidly contained and confined to health care settings and persons in close face-to-face contact with patients, and other areas, such as Hong Kong and Toronto, where transmission is continuing despite the prompt isolation of patients and introduction of strict barrier nursing practices.   WHO has established a set of priority issues requiring urgent scientific investigation. More studies are needed about how the disease is spread, the stages of the disease when virus is shed, which bodily secretions carry the virus, and whether certain secretions are more infectious than others. Researchers also need to understand whether persons infected with SARS become more infectious at a certain stage in the course of the disease, and whether factors such as age or underlying disease influence severity and prognosis.   Some of the world’s foremost scientists and clinicians are now collaborating around the clock, through three WHO networks of “virtual” labs and clinics, to find answers to these questions. Evidence can then form the basis for more precise public health advice on how to prevent further spread both internationally and within those countries where cases have occurred. Based on more than five decades of experience, WHO maintains the position that good surveillance and response will contain any infectious diseases.  "
"2003","http://www.who.int/csr/don/2003_03_31/en/index.html"," Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) - multi-country outbreak - Update 15   Disease Outbreak Reported 31 March 2003   Situation in Hong Kong, activities of WHO team in China   Situation in Hong Kong The Hong Kong Department of Health has today issued an unprecedented isolation order to prevent the further spread of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). The isolation order requires residents of Block E of Amoy Garden to remain in their flats until midnight on 9 April.   The decision to issue the isolation order was made following a continued steep rise in the number of SARS cases detected in the building over the past few days. Concern about a possible outbreak in Amoy Garden mounted on Saturday, when 22 of Hong Kong’s 45 new SAR cases hospitalized that day were determined to be residents of the estate. On Sunday, 36 of the 60 new patients admitted to hospital with probable SARS were Amoy Garden residents.   Hong Kong health authorities today informed the public that a cumulative total of 213 residents of Amoy Garden had been admitted to hospital with suspected SARS since reporting on the disease began. Hong Kong’s outbreak began on 12 March when health officials first recognized a cluster of cases of atypical pneumonia in the Prince of Wales Hospital.   Of the 213 Amoy residents affected in the outbreak, 107 patients resided in Block E. In addition, most of these 107 patients from Block E lived in flats that were vertically arranged.   This suggests that SARS may be spreading in Hong Kong according to a different pattern, still involving close person-to-person contact with bodily secretions from an infected person. WHO epidemiologists are considering the possibility that bodily secretions containing the causative virus might somehow enter common systems that link rooms or flats together. This pattern of spread would be in addition to the well-documented face-to-face contact that has been seen in the majority of cases reported so far.   Earlier this month, Hong Kong epidemiologists detected an unusual pattern of transmission among guests and visitors at the Metropole Hotel during the critical period of 15 to 23 February. Guests and visitors at a single floor of the hotel are thought to have spread SARS to Toronto and Singapore and to have started the outbreak in Hong Kong’s Prince of Wales Hospital. No staff at the hotel developed symptoms.   Amoy Garden is a large housing estate consisting of ten 35-storey blocks, where around 15,000 persons reside. It is located in Kowloon District.   WHO has been informed that environmental samples have been taken from the affected flats in Block E and that investigations are under way to determine a possible explanation for this apparent vertical spread of the disease.   Although the investigation is complex, results from testing of the environmental samples should be available within days and will help determine the source of infection in Block E and the mechanisms by which the pathogen has spread.   Hong Kong epidemiologists have identified a possible “index” case in the Amoy Garden outbreak. This is a patient, now hospitalized in Prince of Wales Hospital, who visited his brother, a resident of Block E, several times before hospital admission.   The WHO team in China The expert team spent the day in the Beijing Municipality Center for Disease Control and Prevention reviewing case records for all 10 cases reported in Beijing Municipality. Following the cases in Guangdong province in late January and early February 2003, Beijing Municipality CDC officials said an enhanced local surveillance system was established by adding 11 sentinel hospitals (out of 50 total hospitals) to report cases of atypical pneumonia.   The laboratory service was also geared up to receive specimens and carry out tests in secure conditions. Other preparation included stockpiling of drugs, setting up a public hotline and holding two news conferences. In addition, CDC and hospital staff were trained in prompt reporting of atypical pneumonia and infection control. An isolation unit was established. CDC Beijing said that antibiotics and Ribovirin are being used routinely as treatment and prophylaxis.   The team were told that contact tracing had begun as soon as the first cases of atypical pneumonia had been recognized in Beijing and had been carried out for all subsequent cases. Eight of the cases were imported (from Hong Kong and Taiyuan city, Shanxi province) and two were health care workers who became infected trying to revive a 72 year old man believed to have become ill after visiting a relative with SARS in a Hong Kong hospital. Besides the two health care workers, no other cases have been infected in Beijing.   Discussions concerning a visit by the expert team to Guangdong Province are continuing with the Ministry of Health.   Update on cases and countries As of today, a cumulative total of 1622 cases, with 58 deaths, have been reported from 13 countries. This represents an increase of 72 cases and 4 deaths since the last figures were compiled on Saturday.   The greatest increase in cases occurred in Hong Kong SAR. The additional deaths were reported in Canada (1) and Hong Kong (3). Germany reported its fifth case, and Switzerland its third.  "

"2003","http://www.who.int/csr/don/2003_03_28/en/index.html"," Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) - multi-country outbreak - Update 13  China joins WHO collaborative network   Disease Outbreak Reported 28 March 2003   At a press briefing held today in Beijing, the head of the WHO investigative team in China, John MacKenzie of Australia, announced several steps forward in the government’s commitment to join international efforts to contain a newly emerging infectious disease. (see Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome - Press briefing, Beijing, China )   The WHO team of five experts arrived in Beijing last Sunday to investigate an outbreak of atypical pneumonia that began in Guangdong Province on 16 November 2002.   Experts have strongly suspected a link between the southern China outbreak and current cases of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) that first surfaced in mid-February in Asia. The disease has since spread to 13 countries on three continents.   The WHO investigation is being conducted in collaboration with the Chinese Ministry of Health, the Chinese Centers for Disease Control, and officials from Guangdong Province.   In the initial stage of the investigation, the WHO team compared case definitions used in China with those used by WHO to identify SARS and concluded that most cases of atypical pneumonia reported in China from mid-November until 28 February were “indeed cases of SARS.”   As reported by the WHO team, Chinese authorities have now agreed to join the WHO collaborative effort to contain the SARS outbreak and prevent its further international spread. Chinese institutes will be selected within days to participate in three global electronic networks set up by WHO to facilitate rapid international collaboration on SARS-related scientific and medical problems. Networks of experts are working to further identify and characterize the SARS virus, develop better tools for diagnosis and management, and understand how the disease is transmitted and what works best to prevent its spread.   WHO authorities have also been given access to meticulous records kept on Chinese SARS cases. As China, according to statistics released earlier this week, has experienced the largest number of SARS cases of any country in the world, these data are expected to take understanding of the new disease, and particularly its origins, a major step forward.   One of the greatest challenges in containing new diseases is the lack of understanding of their behaviour as they emerge. The Chinese data, which also cover the longest time frame, are further expected to improve understanding of how the disease spreads from person to person and why some outbreaks appear to have much milder cases than others.   Progress in identifying the causative agent, now being reported by members in a WHO global network of collaborating laboratories, indicates that the causative agent is a new virus in humans that may have jumped the species barrier from its animal host or mutated in ways that have given it more lethal properties. Chinese data may help solve the riddle of how the new virus first began to cause disease in humans.   China released new figures on the Guangdong outbreak on Wednesday, significantly increasing the global cumulative total. On Thursday, officials issued the first reports of cases and deaths in ongoing outbreaks in Beijing province and in the northern province of Shanxi.   China has further agreed today to begin providing up-to-date electronic reports of SARS cases throughout China. These reports will be submitted electronically as official reports to WHO from the Ministry of Health.   According to members of the WHO team in China, the government may need a few days to get the new nationwide system of daily electronic reports in operation.   Update on cases and countries  As of today, a cumulative total of 1485 cases and 53 deaths have been reported from 13 countries. This represents an increase of 77 cases. No new deaths have occurred.   No reports were received from China today due to the decision to introduce a new system of nationwide daily electronic reporting to WHO.   With 58 new cases, Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of China remains the most severely affected area. Other countries reporting new cases include Canada (1), China, Taiwan (4), Singapore (8), and the United States of America (6).   Viet Nam reported no new cases and no new deaths for the fifth day in a row. WHO experts believe that rapid detection of the outbreak and immediate introduction of stringent infection control procedures may have held further transmission at bay.   Some patients recovering  To date, 19 SARS patients have been discharged from hospitals in Hong Kong, 17 from Viet Nam, and 25 from Singapore.  "
"2003","http://www.who.int/csr/don/2003_03_27b/en/index.html"," Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) - multi-country outbreak - Update 12   Disease Outbreak Reported 27 March 2003  SARS virus close to conclusive identification, new tests for rapid diagnosis ready soon   On 17 March, WHO established a global network of leading laboratories to collaborate in the identification of the causative agent of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS).   Early on, labs in the network narrowed the search to members of the paramyxovirus and coronavirus families. Findings shared by network labs earlier this week began pointing, with increasing consistency, to coronaviruses.   “Data from many network laboratories indicate that a coronavirus is the primary cause of the disease,” said WHO virologist and epidemiologist Klaus Stöhr. “This virus is unlike any known human or animal member of this virus family. It is consistently found in specimens from SARS patients from many countries. It has been isolated in cell-culture. We are very close to knowing for sure.”   Conclusive identification of a causative must meet all criteria in the so-called “Koch’s postulate.” The additional experiments needed to fulfil these criteria are currently under way at a laboratory in the Netherlands.   Scientists at Hong Kong University had previously announced, on 21 March, the isolation of a new virus that was strongly suspected to be the causative agent of SARS. The virus was detected in cell culture and by electron microscopy. The identity of the virus was not known at the time.   Earlier this week, researchers at the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) produced strong evidence implicating a coronavirus as the agent that causes SARS. Many labs of the WHO network have since been using molecular tests provided by CDC to confirm the presence of a coronavirus in specimens from patients in various countries.   Rapid progress was also facilitated by the sharing of samples, taken from SARS patients in areas with large numbers of confirmed cases, among participants in the laboratory.   Hong Kong, with 367 patients, many of whom are in intensive care, and 10 deaths remains the most severely affected area.   Sequencing of the virus is ongoing in four laboratories. Results will help classify the virus and refine molecular diagnostic tools. Results will also guide the development of specific interventions.   At present, no treatment beyond good intensive and supportive care has been consistently shown to improve prognosis in persons with SARS.   Scientists in the network suspect that the virus will prove to be an entirely new, or until now undetected, member of the coronavirus family.   Progress in the development of a diagnostic test Efforts to develop a reliable and easy to use diagnostic test are also moving forward quickly. Hong Kong University, Chinese University, and Public Virus Labs, all located in Hong Kong and all members of the WHO network, have devised a basic diagnostic test. In studies using confirmed SARS patients and healthy controls, results to date have been consistently positive in confirmed cases and consistently negative in the healthy controls. Further testing will begin tomorrow.   The Hong Kong diagnostic test is a molecular test based on the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technology. Hong Kong scientists have also developed a diagnostic tool using the immunofluorescence assay (IFA) technique. Validation of the test is being facilitated by gene sequences of the PCR primers electronically by laboratories collaborating in the network. The WHO network is offering to make these test materials immediately available to labs in other countries throughout the world   Over the next few days, samples from hundreds of confirmed and suspected SARS cases will be tested using these new diagnostic tools. In so doing, the tools will be further refined and streamlined to upgrade their capacity for daily screening of large numbers of samples.   The PCR test is already showing good reliability in detecting SARS cases in the early days of infection. The IFA test is being used to detect infection in convalescent sera at about three weeks after infection begins. Together, the two tests should help to quickly and safely reassure the many patients the world over who are concerned about suspicious symptoms and yet may be suffering from common illnesses safely treated at home.   Procedures of isolation and strict barrier nursing, recommended by WHO for the management of suspected SARS cases, have placed a heavy burden on health care services in several affected areas.   Update on cases and countries As of today, a cumulative total of 1408 cases and 53 deaths have been reported from 13 countries. Romania is reporting its first 3 probable cases today. This represents an increase of 85 cases and 4 deaths compared with the previous day.   New data from China The Chinese Ministry of Health has today officially reported 792 cases and 31 deaths, up to 28 February, in Guangdong Province. Approximately 30% of these cases occurred in health workers.   The Chinese Ministry of Health has further reported on SARS cases in other parts of China. In Beijing, 10 cases and 3 deaths have occurred as of 26 March. Two of these cases are in health workers. In the northern province of Shanxi, four cases, with no deaths, have occurred as of 26 March. Two cases are in health workers.  "

The recommended measures include screening of air passengers departing from a small number of affected areas on flights to another country. The affected areas, where transmission of the SARS infectious agent is known to be spreading in a human-to-human chain, are kept under constant review and posted each day on the WHO web site. At present, only four countries are concerned. ( see affected areas )   No additional precautions for the screening of departing passengers at airports in any other parts of the world are called for in today’s recommendations.   The screening measures, recommended for consideration by national health officials and port authorities, involve an interview with passengers, departing from a limited number of areas, to detect illness with symptoms that give reason to suspect that a passenger may be infected with SARS.   National authorities may wish to advise travellers with fever, departing on international flights from the few areas where SARS transmission has been documented, to postpone travel until they feel better. All international travellers should be aware of the symptoms of SARS and seek immediate medical attention should symptoms occur. Clinicians hold virtual conference on management of SARS patients   Since global surveillance of SARS began at the end of February, some evidence suggests that a small number of suspected and probable cases of SARS have departed from the small number of affected countries on flights to other countries.   Most cases continue to occur in persons in close face-to-face contact with SARS patients. Close face-to-face contact could conceivably occur in an aircraft among persons seated close to a person infected with SARS and coughing or sneezing.   WHO has also issued detailed recommendations to airlines on steps to take should a suspected case of SARS be detected in flight. The WHO recommendations include advice on step-by-step procedures for following up fellow passengers on the flight who may have had close contact with the possible case and the specific advice that should be given to these travellers and their families.   WHO recommends that contacts of a person be allowed to continue to travel so long as they do not have symptoms compatible with SARS.   The WHO case definition, which is being widely used for surveillance purposes, is posted at the WHO web site and is kept under constant review. Case Definitions for Surveillance of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS)   Many national health authorities have also issued SARS-related advice to international travellers.  "
"2003","http://www.who.int/csr/don/2003_03_26/en/index.html"," Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) multi-country outbreak - Update 10   Disease Outbreak Reported   26 March 2003  Data from China, countries introduce stringent control measures   China updates data on cases and deaths Chinese authorities have today officially reported a total of 792 cases and 31 deaths in an outbreak of atypical pneumonia that began in southern China, in Guangdong Province on 16 November 2002. Cases were reported to have occurred in 7 cities of Guangdong Province.   Chinese authorities had previously reported to WHO, on 14 February, a total of 305 cases and 5 deaths from 16 November to 9 February 2003.   The new figures cover the period of 16 November to 28 February.   A WHO team of 5 international experts, which arrived in China on the weekend, has today reviewed the case definition used in reporting cases of atypical pneumonia in Guangdong Province. The WHO team compared this definition with the WHO definition used to identify probable cases of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), and concluded that the two definitions are compatible.   Following in-depth discussion with central-level authorities and health officials in Guangdong Province on the details of several clusters of cases, the WHO expert team reached the conclusion that the atypical pneumonia cases which began occurring in southern China in November 2002 are likely cases of the same disease, now referred to as SARS, that began appearing in other Asian countries on 26 February and has since spread widely to several cities throughout the world.   Chinese authorities further informed the WHO team of a new reporting system that will rely on regular provincial updates. WHO is expecting further information on reported cases in China for March as these data become available.   Case management guidelines being used in China are in line with WHO recommendations for minimizing further transmission.   China is also beginning a collaborative programme in which sera from infected Chinese patients will be exchanged with the WHO network of collaborating laboratories who are working to identify the SARS causative agent.   Update on reported cases The new data from China bring the total number of reported probable cases worldwide, dating back to 16 November, to 1323 cases and 49 deaths. When the data from China are excluded, today’s figures represent an increase of 41 cases, largely concentrated in Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of China, and one death, in Singapore, compared with yesterday. Full details are available on the WHO web site. Cumulative Number of Reported Cases (SARS).   National measures to contain further spread Several countries are introducing maximum measures, including quarantine, to prevent the further spread of SARS.   New diseases such as SARS are poorly understood as they emerge. At the beginning of an outbreak, it is sound public health policy to institute maximum control measures needed to prevent further spread.   Maximum measures are justified when, in the view of national health authorities, they can be expected to protect populations against infection, keep the disease from spreading into the general population, and help prevent international spread to other countries, particularly through air travel.   As the epidemiology of SARS becomes more fully understood, such measures can be adjusted and reduced in line with what is known about how the disease is transmitted and what works best to stop its spread, both nationally and internationally.   First clinical “grand rounds” on SARS held today The first global “grand rounds” on SARS clinical features and treatment were held today by WHO. The electronic meeting united 80 clinicians from 13 countries. A summary of their discussions and conclusions has been posted today at the WHO web site. Clinicians hold virtual conference on management of SARS patients.   Progress towards identification of the virus Research attention is increasingly focusing on the Coronavirus family, though viruses from the Paramyxovirus and other families are also being considered as scientists cast the widest possible net in their search for the cause of SARS. Many are of the opinion that a diagnostic test could rapidly follow conclusive identification of the pathogen. Experts in the network are also considering the theory that SARS is caused by co-infection with two new viruses that somehow need each other in order to cause severe disease in humans. Evidence is strongly pointing to a new virus, or possibly two new viruses, that have not previously been known to infect humans or cause severe disease.   Hypotheses include a virus known to cause disease in an animal host that has jumped the species barrier to infect humans, or a known human virus that has mutated to acquire properties that are causing much more severe disease in humans. It is increasingly certain, however, that SARS is a serious new disease caused by a newly recognized pathogen.  "

Since then, WHO has conducted daily teleconferences with health authorities and WHO team members on the scene in all areas affected by SARS.   WHO also receives detailed bulletins from ministries of health in the most heavily affected areas reporting on any SARS-related events that might alter understanding of the behaviour of this new disease.   Today’s communications included a report, from the Hong Kong department of health, providing detailed preliminary data on the detection of nine atypical pneumonia cases among members of a Beijing tour organized by a Hong Kong travel agent. Investigation of these cases, including tentative identification of the index case, has progressed rapidly. The Hong Kong department of health is tracing, for surveillance purposes, the crew members and passengers who had taken two flights. The general public has been informed and a hot-line has been set up.   WHO epidemiologists in Geneva, together with experts tracking outbreaks in affected countries, have decided today that, based on the information available at present, there is no need to change previous WHO advice.   WHO continues to recommend no travel restrictions to any destination. WHO advises travellers to remain alert to the symptoms of SARS. These include high fever, respiratory symptoms, including cough, shortness of breath, and difficulty breathing, and should report these symptoms promptly.   As of today, 487 SARS cases have been reported from 12 countries.   A number of persons with SARS have taken long distance flights after becoming ill. Thousands of passengers who travelled in the same flights have been traced in Germany, Canada, Singapore and the United States. No cases have been discovered among these contacts. Today's report of a possible transmission of SARS on board a flight is undergoing investigation. As “close” contact is possible during a flight, in passengers sitting close to an infected person, such transmission cannot be ruled out. The evidence to date indicates that in-flight transmission is very unusual.   Health authorities and hospital staff the world over are now alert to the symptoms of SARS. Suspect cases are being quickly detected and promptly reported. Proper isolation and management of cases has greatly reduced the risk of transmission of newly detected cases to others.   WHO advice to travellers is being kept under constant review. SARS is an emerging disease. Knowledge about is clinical behaviour, response to treatment, and modes and risks of transmission are continually evolving.   WHO is confident that, in the present climate of heightened awareness and rapid and detailed reporting, data useful in understanding SARS and issuing sound public health advice are being rapidly collected and rapidly made available.

Since then, more than 450 cases, with 17 deaths, have been reported from 13 countries on three continents.   On 15 March, WHO issued an emergency travel advisory, based on information available at that time, and a preliminary case definition of SARS. The travel advisory was intended to alert national authorities and clinicians to potential cases of SARS and to urge travellers, including airline crew, with symptoms suggestive of SARS to seek medical attention.   WHO continues to recommend, on the basis of currently available data, no travel restrictions to any destination. Guidance to governments, airlines, physicians and travellers issued on 15 March remains valid. WHO issues emergency travel advisory.   Advice for health authorities and clinicians A more detailed clinical picture of SARS has been posted at the WHO Web site: Preliminary Clinical Description of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome.    WHO has further recommended that suspect cases be placed in isolation and managed using strict barrier nursing practices: Management of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS)   Drawing on partners in the Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network, WHO and its partner institutes and collaborating centres have placed field teams in Hanoi, Viet Nam, Hong Kong SAR, and Taiwan, China to assist health authorities. Last week, WHO flew 300 kilos of protective equipment and medical supplies to Hanoi.   Health authorities and hospital staff the world over are now alert to the symptoms of SARS. Suspect cases are being quickly detected and promptly reported. Proper isolation and management of cases has greatly reduced the risk of transmission of newly detected cases to others.   As of data available today, the vast majority of cases continue to occur in health care workers managing patients in hospital environments, and in the families and other close contacts of patients. Cumulative total of reported cases, 24 March.   Update on cases and countries affected Reports from health authorities in 13 countries, compiled today, indicate a cumulative total of 456 cases of SARS and 17 deaths. This compares with reports a week ago (17 March) of 150 cases in 7 countries. Cumulative total of reported cases, 24 March.   For most of the affected countries, cases reported today are for probable cases. Previous reports included both probable and suspected cases. As case definitions of SARS differ in some countries, the United States of America is today reporting 37 suspect cases under investigation.   Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of China remains the most severely affected area, reporting 260 cases and 10 deaths. Other severely affected areas included Singapore, with 65 cases and no deaths, and Vietnam, with 58 cases and 4 deaths. Canada has reported 11 cases and 3 deaths.   Chest X-rays showing distinctive features of SARS are presently the main tool for distinguishing suspected from probable cases. A “hand-made” diagnostic test, developed by Hong Kong scientists, began producing reliable results on Saturday and will be made available to key laboratories in a matter of days. A more sophisticated test is expected to be available for widespread use in diagnosing SARS cases within weeks.   Work towards the definitive identification of the causative agent, now strongly expected to be a virus of the Paramyxovirus or Coronavirus families, is continuing at breakneck speed. Researchers in a network of 11 leading laboratories, set up on Monday 17 March, exchange data on a restricted web site and compare virological and clinical information during daily teleconferences.   A second network of clinicians was set up on 20 March to expedite work on diagnosis and treatment.   WHO team of experts in China A WHO international team of experts in epidemiology, microbiology, virology, and respiratory diseases arrived in Beijing, China on Sunday 23 March. The multinational team was assembled in response to a request from the Chinese Ministry of Health to investigate possible links between the current SARS outbreak, which began in Asia in mid-February, and an outbreak of atypical pneumonia which began in Guangdong Province in China in mid-November.   The WHO team, which includes experts from 5 countries, will review available epidemiological and laboratory data on cases in the southern China outbreak. It will also propose what additional investigations should be carried out, and which additional reagents, antibodies, tests, equipment and expertise might be required to continue the laboratory and virological work. This additional expertise and equipment is expected to bolster efforts to trace the source of atypical pneumonia in Guangdong Province.   Concern over international spread The first concern WHO has regarding travel is the possibility that the disease will spread rapidly and become established in many countries around the world. The extent to which this is happening is being monitored by heightened surveillance for SARS symptoms around the world and rapid reporting of suspected cases.   The worldwide awareness of the disease has been demonstrated by the number of countries reporting to WHO. Recommended isolation procedures appear to be working. Since these measures were introduced, no onward transmission of the disease, beyond those initially identified, has been reported.   In these circumstances, where the rapid identification and isolation of cases appears to be containing international spread, WHO does not consider that any additional restrictions on travel or trade are required.   Concerns over travel to affected areas As countries around the world have increased surveillance activities they have discovered a small number of cases in persons who have traveled to the affected areas. The small number of such cases, at present, is an indication that SARS poses little risk to travellers visiting the affected areas.   Based on available information, WHO does not consider that the small health risk attributable to SARS significantly increases the health risk associated with travel to any destination. WHO therefore maintains its advice that no SARS-related restrictions on travel to any destination are necessary.   WHO is aware that a number of countries have advised their nationals to consider postponing unnecessary or elective travel to the areas where local transmission of the disease has been demonstrated. Such advice does not amount to a restriction of travel, and is the responsibility of the concerned national authorities.     Concern about air travel The public is also concerned about the safety of air travel. Cases that have been identified in countries outside the initially affected areas have arrived by air transport.   It is important to note that there is no evidence to date to indicate that the disease is transmitted during air travel, or that travelling in an aeroplane with an infected person has resulted in illness to other passengers or crew. In case of concern that passengers have been exposed to an infected person during a flight, a protocol exists for the follow up of passengers and crew. When an airline wishes to disinfect an aeroplane after carrying a suspected SARS case there is good reason to believe that the procedures described in the WHO Guide to Hygiene and Sanitation in Aviation will be fully effective.

Further progress in the development of a reliable diagnostic test was simultaneously announced by the same team.   Using a special cell line, the Hong Kong scientists isolated the virus from the lung tissue of a patient who developed pneumonia following contact with a professor from Guangdong Province in southern China. Both the professor and the contact have died.   Isolation of the virus now lays the solid foundation for very rapid development of a diagnostic test.   The Hong Kong scientists have devised a basic test, relying on the technique of neutralizing antibodies. In today’s experiments designed to determine the accuracy of the test, scientists found that it was able to detect tell-tale antibodies in sera taken from eight SARS patients. The consistency of these findings indicates that the test is reliably identifying cases of SARS infection.   This “hand-made” test will now be further developed into a more sophisticated diagnostic test. A rapid and reliable diagnostic test for SARS is urgently needed to assist the many clinicians who need a tool for rapid confirmation of genuine cases. Such a test can also help reassure the many “worried well” who are flooding health facilities as international concern about this disease and its rapid spread to new areas continues to increase.   Many common and usually self-healing illnesses mimic the symptoms of SARS in its early stage.   With the virus now isolated, scientists in Hong Kong and elsewhere can move forward quickly to characterize the agent, determine its relationship with known viruses, and establish a definitive identity. Results will be shared among 11 leading laboratories in a network set up on Monday 17 March by WHO.   Exceptionally rapid progress Close collaboration, with findings shared daily in teleconferences and by email, has allowed advances that normally need months to take place in a matter of days.   “This spectacular achievement is an example of what the world can do when the intellectual resources of nations around the world are focused on a single problem,” says Klaus Stöhr, a WHO virologist who is coordinating the global laboratory network.   “Scientists who are by default academic competitors are now working virtually shoulder to shoulder. In less than a week, they have produced results which, in other circumstances, would likely have taken months or more. This rapid advance is fuelling the hope that SARS can and will be contained.” The virus responsible for SARS is considered by some research groups to be a member of the well-known Paramyxoviridae family. Yesterday, Canadian researchers released findings suggesting that the metapneumovirus, which belongs to this family, may be the cause.   The metapneumovirus was first discovered by Dutch scientists in June 2001 at a laboratory that is also included in the new WHO network. At the time of its discovery, the virus was known to cause respiratory disease in humans, including some cases of pneumonia, but showed a different transmission pattern and was much less severe than the SARS agent.   At this point, it cannot be ruled out that an entirely different virus from another family may be responsible for the SARS outbreak.   Identity of virus remains elusive WHO cautions that the race to identify the SARS causative agent is by no means over. Although the virus has now been isolated, its identity remains elusive. Other research groups in the network of collaborating labs are producing hints that the causative agent may belong to another virus family.   SARS is an emerging disease, first recognized in Asia in mid-February, that has sickened over 380 persons on three continents and caused severe pneumonia in a large proportion of patients. A cumulative list of affected countries and numbers of cases and deaths is released each day on the WHO web site. Today’s data indicate that the vast majority of reported cases continue to occur in health care workers, family members and close contacts of patients.   Investigative team travelling to China A WHO team of five experts is now en route to China to investigate the possibility that an outbreak of a disease having similar symptoms and affecting similar groups – health care workers and close contacts of patients – may be linked to the current SARS outbreak.   As of today, Hong Kong remains the most seriously affected area. Authorities there have reported a total of 222 cases in health care workers, medical students, and family members and hospital visitors who have been in close contact with patients. Of these, 217 have developed symptoms of pneumonia, and many are in serious condition.  "
"2003","http://www.who.int/csr/don/2003_03_21/en/index.html"," Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) multi-country outbreak - Update 6   Disease Outbreak Reported   21 March 2003  Major step forward towards development of diagnostic test   A laboratory in a new network set up on Monday 17 March has today succeeded in growing, in cell culture, an infectious agent that might be the cause of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS).   This major step towards the development of a diagnostic test has occurred despite the failure, up to now, to pinpoint the exact identity of the causative agent.   Researchers at the laboratory took serum samples from the blood of recovering SARS patients and a matching number of healthy volunteers in what is known as a “blinded” test.   Serum from patients infected by a virus usually contains neutralizing antibodies that stop the growth of the virus – whatever its identity – when added to a cell culture in which the virus has been successfully grown.   When the researchers added serum from SARS patients to the cell culture, virus growth was halted. Serum from uninfected healthy controls had no effect on the virus.   “This is not just some light at the end of the tunnel,” said WHO virologist Dr Klaus Stöhr, who is coordinating the collaborative laboratory efforts. “This is a real ray of sunshine.”   WHO cautions, however, that the number of patients in the test was small and more work needs to be done. The scientific community is excited by the news, which could be regarded as the first important step towards the development of a diagnostic test.   The infectious agent resembles the morphology of a Paramyxovirus. Scientists cannot, however, be certain about the identity of the virus, which may indeed be a new Paramyxovirus or another virus with a similar morphology.   The laboratory is one of 11 leading labs participating in an international multicentre research project. The project was set up by WHO on Monday to expedite identification of the causative agent – considered by several research groups to be a member of the Paramyxoviridae family of viruses – and rapidly develop a diagnostic test.   WHO team of experts travelling to China   A WHO team of five infectious disease experts will be travelling over the weekend to China to support investigations there of an outbreak of atypical pneumonia that began in Guangdong Province in mid-November.   The multinational team was assembled in response to a request from the Chinese Ministry of Health for epidemiological and laboratory support to aid ongoing investigation of the outbreak. The team will also assist in laboratory work that might lead to identification of the causative agent.   The team includes experts in virology, laboratory techniques, epidemiological investigation, and the control of unusual infectious diseases. Team members, of American, Australian, British, and German nationality, have been drawn from institutes participating in the WHO Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network.   The outbreak in southern China is linked geographically and by timing to the current outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), which first surfaced in Asia in mid-February and caused its first known death on 13 March. Cases of this new disease have now been detected in 13 countries on three continents. Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of China, which as of today accounts for 203 of the 350 suspected or probable cases reported worldwide, remains the most severely affected area.   Apart from searching for the causative agent, the WHO team is expected to help Chinese scientists determine whether the Guangdong outbreak included cases that fit the current definition of SARS.   Conclusive identification of the causative agent, which is thought to be a virus of the Paramyxoviridae family, would greatly aid the investigation by Chinese scientists and the WHO team, which is expected to begin on Monday.   Research on the identity of the SARS pathogen is progressing rapidly within a network of 11 leading laboratories set up by WHO earlier this week. WHO remains optimistic that a definitive announcement of the cause of SARS can be made soon.   History of the Guangdong outbreak   WHO was first officially informed of the outbreak on 11 February, when the Chinese Ministry of Health reported that 305 cases of acute respiratory syndrome of unknown cause had occurred in six municipalities in Guangdong Province in southern China. Five deaths were reported. Transmission of the disease was largely confined to health care workers (105 doctors, nurses, and other medical workers) and household contacts of patients.   On 14 February, WHO was informed by the Chinese Ministry of Health that the outbreak was clinically consistent with atypical pneumonia. Reported symptoms included fever, dizziness, muscle soreness, and bouts of coughing. Patients had acute symptoms, included high fever, dry cough, muscle pain, and weakness, and required hospitalization. The Chinese authorities also provided information that cases had been detected in the province as far back as 16 November 2002.   In mid-February, some Chinese experts concluded that the outbreak was caused by chlamydial organisms. Others speculated that a virus might be the cause.   It is hoped that the WHO team can help authorities quickly resolve these and other outstanding questions about the Guangdong outbreak.   Update on cases and affected countries As of 21 March, 350 suspected and probable cases, including 10 deaths, have been reported from 13 countries. These figures represent an additional 44 cases and two new countries compared with the previous day. The number of deaths remains unchanged.   Countries reported their first suspected cases are Italy and the Republic of Ireland, each reporting one case. New cases were reported in Hong Kong (30), Singapore (5), Taiwan, China (2), Thailand (3), and the United States of America (2).   New guidelines for health authorities WHO has today posted on its web site two documents to assist national authorities in the investigation and management of cases. The first gives a more complete, though still preliminary, clinical picture of SARS, pooled from findings provided by clinicians treating SARS patients in seven countries. It is anticipated that the clinical description will help health authorities recognize cases with greater precision.   The second document provides advice, including recommended laboratory tests and radiological findings, that can guide the safe discharge and follow-up of convalescent cases. The policy advice aims to ensure that the release of recovered patients carries no risks for family members and other close contacts. Until more is known about the etiological agent, and the potential for continued carriage, WHO is recommending a cautious approach.  "

WHO is increasingly optimistic that conclusive identification of the causative agent can be announced soon. The development of a precise diagnostic test could follow quickly. Collaboration in the race to find the causative agent is taking place within the framework of a network of labs set up on Monday. Research is now focused on the Paramyxoviridae family of viruses. This family includes several well-known viruses, such as those causing mumps, measles and common respiratory ailments. It also includes a subfamily of viruses capable of infecting multiple animal species, including humans. This subfamily was implicated in the emergence during the 1990s of new and severe diseases in humans caused by Hendra and Nipah viruses. The virus jumped directly from animal hosts (horses and pigs) to humans. No person-to-person transmission was documented in outbreaks caused by either virus. New treatment network WHO has today established a cooperative network of clinicians for SARS diagnosis and treatment. The network brings together, via two daily teleconferences, clinicians in the most heavily affected Asian countries and in Europe and North America. Clinicians participate on the basis of either first-hand experience in the management of SARS cases or leading expertise in the diagnosis and management of unusual infectious diseases. Participants are pooling data on cases and sharing X-ray pictures. Chest X-rays are, at present, one of the main tools for distinguishing between suspected and probable cases. Treatment guidelines, including criteria for safe discharge of patients from hospitals, are also being established on the basis of shared experiences. Pending definitive identification of the causative agent, a combination of treatments are being tried to cure cases. WHO is providing support, in the form of protective equipment and supplies, to help the most heavily affected hospitals prevent further spread within hospital settings, where the overwhelming majority of new infections have occurred. If a paramyxovirus is confirmed to be the cause, WHO will be in a much better position to recommend a treatment. The antiviral drug, ribavirin, may be responsible for some degree of clinical improvement observed in critically ill patients in Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of China. Intensive and good supportive care have also been associated with improved prospects of recovery. Update on cases and affected countries As of 20 March, 306 suspected and probable cases, including 10 deaths, have been reported from eleven countries. These figures represent an additional 42 cases and one death compared with the previous day. Increases were reported in Canada (1), Hong Kong (23), Singapore (3), Taiwan, China (1), the United Kingdom (1), and Viet Nam (6). Switzerland, reporting 7 suspected cases, was added to the list. Possible cases in airline passengers and crew member ruled out Press reports have referred to 2 suspected cases of SARS, one in an airline crew member and a second in a passenger, travelling on separate flights from Hong Kong and Taipei to Viet Nam. Both suspected cases have been investigated and are now ruled out as cases of SARS. Index case in Hong Kong outbreak WHO has welcomed a report from the Hong Kong  Department of Health, released yesterday, that may have identified the “index” case in the outbreak in the Prince of Wales Hospital in Hong Kong. In an outstanding example of detective work, epidemiologists have determined that 7 people who contracted SARS recently stayed in or visited the Metropole hotel in Kowloon last month. The 7 persons investigated include 3 visitors from Singapore, 2 from Canada, one China Mainland visitor, and a local Hong Kong resident. The investigation revealed that all 7 stayed in or visited the same floor of the hotel between 12 February and 2 March. The local Hong Kong resident is believed to be the index case, who subsequently infected other early cases in the outbreak. He had visited an acquaintance staying at the hotel from 15 to 23 February. The visitor from Mainland China, who became sick a week before staying at the hotel, is considered the original source of the infection. No further cases have been linked to the hotel. Absolute need for continued vigilance WHO is underscoring the need for continued vigilance. Experience with other emerging diseases makes it clear that, should the causative agent turn out to be a virus, the new disease could establish endemicity, especially in light of abundantly documented human-to-human transmission. The world must protect itself against the widespread establishment of another new infectious disease. WHO concern is now increasingly focused on preparation to assist vulnerable countries in the likely event that cases continue to spread. Up to now, all imported cases have occurred in countries well-equipped and well-prepared to institute WHO-recommended precautions, including isolation and barrier nursing practices, for preventing spread to others, whether health care workers or family members. In view of the rapid spread of this disease to new countries via exposed air travellers, any country with an international airport is potentially at risk. This focus on preparedness underscores the need for a concerted effort to defend global public health security. In an era of close interconnectedness and rapid air travel, an outbreak anywhere in the world is a potential threat to health everywhere. International collaboration – on the part of the medical and research communities, multinational teams in the field, and health authorities around the world – in the reporting, investigation,  and management of this outbreak has been outstanding.

"2003","http://www.who.int/csr/don/2003_03_19/en/index.html"," Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) multi-country outbreak - Update 4   Disease Outbreak Reported  19 March 2003   Preliminary findings suggest a viral cause  Research teams at two laboratories, in Germany and Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of China, have detected particles of a virus from the Paramyxoviridae family in samples taken from patients with Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). This is the first major step forward in efforts to pinpoint the causative agent. Previous tests conducted in a number of top laboratories failed to detect the presence of any known bacteria or viruses, including the influenza viruses, recognized as causes of pneumonia or respiratory symptoms, or known to be widespread in the most affected geographical areas. The failure of all previous efforts to detect the presence of bacteria and viruses known to cause respiratory disease strongly suggests that the causative agent may be a novel pathogen. Firm conclusions about the identity of the causative agent are premature. All teams have stressed that these are preliminary results only. Further studies are needed before it can be concluded, with confidence, that the causative agent has been identified. Collaborative efforts continue. All research teams are participants in the international multicentre SARS research project, linking together 11 leading laboratories, that was set up on Monday 17 March. Coordinated research is expected to expedite definitive identification of the causative agent. The detection of paramyxovirus particles in samples from infected patients is the first lead to a possible cause of SARS and will be extremely important in focusing ongoing research. Definitive identification of the causative agent will help physicians move from the current “hit-or-miss” approach to treatment to a more precise selection of drugs with a greater prospect of cure. Knowledge of the causative agent will also speed development of a diagnostic test and thus give physicians and national health authorities a powerful tool for the identification of cases. It will also reassure the many “worried well” now presenting at health facilities, and reduce the number of false alarms. Update on countries and cases As of Wednesday 19 March, a cumulative total of 264 suspected or probable cases and 9 deaths have been reported from 10 countries (Canada, China, Germany Singapore, Slovenia, Spain, Thailand, the United Kingdom, the United States of America, and Viet Nam). Hong Kong SAR, Hanoi (Viet Nam), and Singapore continue to be the most affected areas. Full details are provided in tabular form.  Awareness of the disease is now very high throughout the world. Surveillance is proving to be sensitive, with suspected cases rapidly detected, reported to national authorities and WHO, and investigated according to the standard case definition. The Paramyxoviridae family Viruses in the Paramyxoviridae family include many common, well-known agents associated with respiratory infections, such as respiratory syncytial virus, and childhood illnesses, including the viruses that cause mumps and measles. Some of these viruses are widespread, particularly during the winter season. Screening of specimens could therefore be expected to detect particles of these common viruses. At this point, it cannot be ruled out entirely that tests for the SARS agent are detecting such “background” viruses rather than the true causative agent. The Paramyxoviridae family also includes two recently recognized pathogens, Hendra virus and Nipah virus. These related viruses are unusual in the family in that they can infect and cause potentially fatal disease in a number of animal hosts, including humans. Most other viruses in the family tend to infect a single animal species only. Nipah virus first began to cause deaths in humans in Peninsular Malaysia in 1998 in persons in close contact with pigs. The outbreak caused 265 cases of human encephalitis, including 105 deaths. Two separate outbreaks of Hendra virus, associated with severe respiratory disease in horses, caused two human deaths in Australia in 1994 and 1995. No human-to-human transmission was documented in either outbreak.  No treatment was available for cases caused by either of these two viruses. Human-to-human transmission did not occur.  "
"2003","http://www.who.int/csr/don/2003_03_18/en/index.html"," Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) multi-country outbreak - Update 3   18 March 2003 Disease Outbreak Reported   Advice for travellers   Currently available findings from the outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), continue to indicate that the overwhelming majority of cases are occurring in health care workers, and their families who have had direct contact with SARS patients. The number of cases without such close contact remains few, and no data indicate that this number is rapidly increasing. Based on current knowledge, WHO considers that the emergency travel advice issued on Saturday 15th March remains valid.   WHO advises that no restrictions on travel to any destination are necessary. Persons travelling to Asia and the Far East should be aware of the major symptoms of SARS, and of the need to report promptly to a health care worker in the unlikely event that they fall ill during their travel or after returning home.   For the full WHO travel advisory, together with additional information about this disease. Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS)    Current situation   Isolated cases of suspected SARS continue to be reported in new countries. As of today, health authorities are investigating reported cases in Canada, China, Taiwan (China), Germany, Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of China, Singapore, Slovenia, Thailand, Viet Nam, and the United Kingdom. Further details, including cumulative number of cases and deaths, are given in the table below. Cumulative number of reported suspect and probable cases    At present, the vast majority of cases are concentrated in Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of China and Hanoi, Viet Nam. Singapore is currently reporting the third largest number of cases. All reported cases in other parts of the world are linked to travel within the past 10 days to one of these destinations. It remains undetermined whether an outbreak of atypical pneumonia in southern China, which began in November, is related to the current outbreaks.   In Hanoi, 13 of the 57 patients are showing signs of clinical improvement.   Two cases suspected in Switzerland on Monday have been investigated and ruled out as cases of SARS.   Awareness of the disease is now very high throughout the world. Surveillance is proving to be sensitive, with suspected cases rapidly detected, reported to national authorities and WHO, and investigated according to the standard case definition.   An increase in the number of suspected cases is to be expected in such an atmosphere of heightened awareness.   In areas where person-to-person transmission has been documented, cases have occurred almost exclusively in health care workers or in persons in very close contact with patients, such as family members. Currently available data indicate that transmission of the infectious agent requires direct and close contact. There is no evidence of transmission following casual contact.   Due to heightened awareness, cases are now being quickly identified and immediately isolated. No cases of secondary transmission are occurring following the detection and proper management of imported cases.   Protective measures and strict barrier nursing procedures are now in place in hospitals in all areas where cases have been reported. In areas where person-to-person transmission has occurred, these measures are expected to decrease transmission to health staff and families of patients. Strict protective measures in countries managing imported cases are likewise expected to reduce the risk that the disease will spread to others within these countries.   Efforts are under way to expedite identification of the causative agent, improve diagnostic precision, and develop a diagnostic test. A network of 11 highly qualified laboratories in 10 countries was established yesterday and has begun data sharing and regular reporting today.   Many countries have activated well-designed national preparedness plans for dealing with an emerging infectious disease. The global surveillance system, which WHO coordinates, is working well in the ways needed to prevent the outbreak from becoming a global epidemic.   Updates on the development of the SARS outbreak are regularly posted on the WHO website   "
"2003","http://www.who.int/csr/don/2003_03_17/en/index.html"," Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) - multi-country outbreak - Update 2   17 March 2003 Disease Outbreak Reported   NOTE FOR THE PRESS ISSUED BY WHO 17 March 2003  WHO coordinates international effort to identify and treat SARS   17 March 2003 -- WHO has today stepped up several activities aimed at strengthening the international response to the recent emergence of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). SARS is an infectious disease of unknown etiology characterized by atypical pneumonia (see WHO press release of 15 March and additional information at www.who.int.)   The disease is spread from person to person but only through close contact with a case. To date, almost all reported cases have occurred in health workers involved in the direct care of reported cases or in close contacts, such as family members. There is no evidence to date that the disease spreads though casual contact.   The WHO Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network is coordinating an international multicenter effort to identify the causative agent. The project unites 11 laboratories in 10 countries. Participating laboratories have the most experience to date in diagnosis of cases, or are known for their high-level facilities and expertise. The collaborative effort will also improve diagnostic precision and move work forward on the development of a diagnostic test. WHO is also working with health authorities to identify an effective treatment for SARS.   WHO Global Outbreak Alert and Response teams in Hanoi and Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, China, where the most new cases are presently concentrated, are assisting health authorities in outbreak management and in the collection of epidemiological and clinical data that can improve understanding of SARS.   Through its regional office in Manila, Philippines, WHO is establishing logistics bases and supply chains to ensure rapid provision of protective equipment and medicines needed for outbreak response.   Chinese authorities have now issued a summary report on an outbreak of what may be the same or a related disease that began in Guangdong province in southern China in November and peaked in mid-February. The Chinese report, which includes data on the diagnosis and management of more than 300 cases, is presently undergoing analysis and is expected to further contribute to understanding about the syndrome and possible links among the various outbreaks. The Chinese report, which covers the largest number of cases to date, may also boost international efforts to establish effective treatment guidelines, should a relationship between the outbreaks be established.   The Ministry of Health of China has requested support from an international team. A WHO team is now being assembled.   Health authorities around the world are now alert to the risk of SARS. Tracking of the course of the epidemic shows that surveillance systems are sensitive, communication channels are open, and reporting is rapid. Information on cases compiled over the past three weeks is expected to shed new light on the behaviour of this disease.   The speed of international travel creates a risk of rapid spread to additional areas. Because the clinical course and epidemiological behaviour of this disease are poorly understood, WHO is calling upon national health authorities to maintain close vigilance for suspected cases. There is no current justification for any restriction in travel or trade.

"2003","http://www.who.int/csr/don/2003_03_16/en/index.html"," Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) - multi-country outbreak - Update   16 March 2003 Disease Outbreak Reported   As of 15 March 2003, reports of over 150 cases of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), an atypical pneumonia of unknown aetiology, have been received by the World Health Organization (WHO) since 26 February 2003 ( see previous report ). WHO is co-ordinating the international investigation of this outbreak and is working closely with health authorities in the affected countries to provide epidemiological, clinical and logistical support as required.   SARS was first recognised on the 26 February 2003 in Hanoi, Viet Nam. The causative agent has yet to be identified. The main symptoms and signs include high fever (>38 degrees C), cough, shortness of breath or breathing difficulties (see Case definitions for Surveillance of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome ). A proportion of patients with SARS develop severe pneumonia; some of whom have needed ventilator support. As of 15 March, four deaths have been reported.   As of 15 March the majority of cases have occurred in people who have had very close contact with other cases and over 90% of cases have occurred in health care workers.   The mode of transmission and the causative agent have yet to be determined. Aerosol and/or droplet spread is possible as is transmission from body fluids. Respiratory isolation, strict respiratory and mucosal barrier nursing  are recommended for cases. Cases should be treated as clinically indicated. (see below for further details).   Hospital infection control guidance for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS)    An epidemic of atypical pneumonia had previously been reported by the Chinese government starting in November 2002 in Guangdong Province. This epidemic is reported to be under control.   Hanoi, Viet Nam On the 26 February 2003, a man (index case) was admitted to hospital in Hanoi with a high fever, dry cough, myalgia and mild sore throat. Over the next four days he developed increasing breathing difficulties, severe thrombocytopenia, and signs of Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome and required ventilator support. Despite intensive therapy he died on the 13 March after being transferred to Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of China.   On 5 March, seven health care workers who had cared for the index case also became ill (high fever, myalgia, headache and less often sore throat). The onset of illness ranged from 4 to 7 days after admission of the index case.   As of 15 March, 43 cases have been reported in Viet Nam. At least five of these patients are currently requiring ventilator support. Two deaths have occurred. With the exception of one case (the son of a health care worker) all cases to date have had direct contact with the hospital where the index case had first received treatment.   Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of China Influenza A(H5N1) reported in February On 12 March 2003, 20 health care workers developed influenza-like symptoms (high fever, headache and lower respiratory symptoms). Since then the number of reported cases has increased daily.   As of 15 March, over 100 reported cases have been hospitalised, at least two of whom are receiving ventilatory support. One death (index case from Viet Nam) has been reported.   Singapore On 13 March 2003, the Ministry of Health in Singapore reported three cases of SARS in people who had recently returned to Singapore after travelling to Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of China.   As of 15 March 2003, 13 additional cases have been reported. All 13 of these cases have had very close contact with one or more of the initial three cases.   All 16 cases are reported to be in a stable condition and are being cared for in isolation.   Thailand As of 15 March 2003, one imported case has been reported in Thailand. The case (a health care worker) travelled to Thailand on the 11 March from Hanoi, Viet Nam. The case is known to have had close contact with the Hanoi index case and to have been unwell on arrival in Thailand. The case was immediately isolated on arrival in Thailand and reported to be in a stable condition and is being cared for in isolation. There is no evidence of transmission of SARS in Thailand.   Canada As of 15 March 2003, seven cases have been reported in Canada; two of whom have died. The cases have occurred in two separate extended family clusters. In both clusters at least one member of the family had travelled to Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of China within a week of developing symptoms.   Philippines and Indonesia Unconfirmed reports of a single case in the Philippines to date. However one close contact of the Hanoi index case is under observation in an isolation facility. This person is reported to be well.   Unconfirmed reports of a single case in Indonesia were received on the 15 March. However further reports have confirmed that this person does not fulfill the case definition. As of 16 March, there are therefore no reported cases in Indonesia.   New York, USA – Frankfurt, Germany On 15 March 2003, a health care worker from Singapore who was visiting New York boarded a flight from New York to Frankfurt. The health care worker was known to be unwell and to have had recent close contact with a reported case of SARS in Singapore. German health authorities were notified and the health care worker was transferred to an isolation unit in Frankfurt as soon as the flight landed. There is no evidence of transmission in Germany.   Laboratory Investigation Various specimens have been collected from cases and post-mortum examinations. A wide range of laboratory tests have been conducted to date but no agent has been definitively identified. Laboratory investigations are continuing.   International Response WHO is assisting affected countries in responding to the various outbreaks. Extensive epidemiological and clinical investigation are ongoing in all affected countries.   WHO/ Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network team of epidemiologists, case management, infection control experts and laboratory experts is assisting the Vietnamese health authorities.

In Viet Nam the outbreak began with a single initial case who was hospitalized for treatment of severe, acute respiratory syndrome of unknown origin. He felt unwell during his journey and fell ill shortly after arrival in Hanoi from Shanghai and Hong Kong SAR, China. Following his admission to the hospital, approximately 20 hospital staff became sick with similar symptoms.   The signs and symptoms of the disease in Hanoi include initial flu-like illness (rapid onset of high fever followed by muscle aches, headache and sore throat). These are the most common symptoms. Early laboratory findings may include thrombocytopenia (low platelet count) and leucopenia (low white blood cell count). In some, but not all cases, this is followed by bilateral pneumonia, in some cases progressing to acute respiratory distress requiring assisted breathing on a respirator. Some patients are recovering but some patients remain critically ill.   Today, the Department of Health Hong Kong SAR has reported on an outbreak of respiratory illness in one of its public hospitals. As of midnight 11 March, 50 health care workers had been screened and 23 of them were found to have febrile illness. They were admitted to the hospital for observation as a precautionary measure. In this group, eight have developed early chest x-ray signs of pneumonia. Their conditions are stable. Three other health care workers self-presented to hospitals with febrile illness and two of them have chest x-ray signs of pneumonia.   Investigation by Hong Kong SAR public health authorities is on-going. The Hospital Authority has increased infection control measures to prevent the spread of the disease in the hospital. So far, no link has been found between these cases and the outbreak in Hanoi.   In mid February, the Government of China reported that 305 cases of atypical pneumonia, with five deaths, had occurred in Guangdong province. In two cases that died, chlamydia infection was found. Further investigations of the cause of the outbreak is ongoing. Overall the outbreaks in Hanoi and Hong Kong SAR appear to be confined to the hospital environment. Those at highest risk appear to be staff caring for the patients.   No link has so far been made between these outbreaks of acute respiratory illness in Hanoi and Hong Kong and the outbreak of `bird flu,` A(H5N1) in Hong Kong SAR reported on 19 February. Further investigations continue and laboratory tests on specimens from Viet Nam and Hong Kong SAR are being studied by WHO collaborating centres in Japan and the United States.   Until more is known about the cause of these outbreaks, WHO recommends patients with atypical pneumonia who may be related to these outbreaks be isolated with barrier nursing techniques. At the same time, WHO recommends that any suspect cases be reported to national health authorities.   WHO is in close contact with relevant national authorities and has also offered epidemiological, laboratory and clinical support. WHO is working with national authorities to ensure appropriate investigation, reporting and containment of these outbreaks.

To date the current outbreak of influenza A(H5N1) in Hong Kong SAR has been limited to two cases, one of whom has died. Both cases were members of the same family who returned to their home in Hong Kong SAR on 8 February after travelling to Fujian province, China. The mother and children were in mainland China for 14 days; the father for 9 days. The father of the family (a 33 year old man) developed respiratory symptoms on 7 February whilst in Fujian Province, China. He was admitted to hospital in Hong Kong SAR on 11 February with pneumonia but died on 17 February. Influenza A (H5N1) was isolated from post-mortum specimens on 20 February. The man´s 9 year old son also became unwell whilst in Fujian province. He was admitted to hospital in Hong Kong SAR on 12 February with pneumonia. Influenza A (H5N1) was isolated from two nasopharageal aspirates taken from the boy on 19 February. The boy is in a stable condition. Additional family members have also had respiratory symptoms. The boy’s 8 year old sister died on 4 February whilst the family was in Fujian Province, China. The cause of her death is under investigation. The mother has now recovered from what was thought to have been a parainfluenza infection. An outbreak of atypical pneumonia occurred between November 2002 and February 2003 in Guandong province, China. Health authorities in China investigated the outbreak and identified Chlamydia pneumoniae as the causitive agent. The Ministry of Health in Beijing has informed WHO that the outbreak in Guandong is over and that there is no evidence of a link between the outbreak in Guandong and the H5N1 cases in Hong Kong SAR. The Department of Health in Hong Kong SAR has intensified its surveillance for influenza among patients with influenza-like symptoms or atypical pneumonia. No unusual increase in influenza activity has been detected over the past few weeks. WHO is continuing to work closely with health authorities in Beijing, China and Hong Kong SAR.

"2004","http://www.who.int/csr/don/2004_10_29/en/index.html"," Avian influenza – situation in Asia: altered role of domestic ducks   29 October 2004   Countries experiencing outbreaks of H5N1 in poultry need to be aware that domestic ducks may have acquired an important role in the transmission of highly pathogenic H5N1 to other poultry and, possibly, to humans as well.   A new laboratory study of domestic ducks infected with several 2004 H5N1 viruses shows that, when compared with infections caused by viruses from 2003, domestic ducks are shedding more virus for longer periods. The majority are doing so without showing symptoms of illness.   Findings from this study also show that, compared to highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses from previous outbreaks, the recent H5N1 viruses survive several days longer in the environment.   The study found that the quantities of virus excreted by healthy-looking ducks approach those excreted by diseased – and visibly very ill – chickens. This suggests that domestic ducks might now be acting as a “silent” reservoir for the H5N1 virus, which is highly pathogenic for chickens. 1   To date, no evidence has linked human H5N1 cases to exposure to asymptomatic domestic ducks. However, the laboratory findings come at a time when some human cases could not be traced to contact with diseased or dead poultry.   In terms of preventing further human cases, it is of public health concern that ducks may be infected and shed virus for long periods, yet issue no “warning signal” in the form of visible signs and symptoms that alert people to take precautions. The concern is greatest in rural areas of affected countries, where free-ranging ducks and chickens often mingle, frequently sharing the same water supplies.   The new findings expand on recent evidence, based on characterization of H5N1 viruses from southern China, that domestic ducks have played a central role in generating and maintaining H5N1, in its highly pathogenic form, in parts of Asia. 2   Findings pointing to an altered role for domestic ducks join other recent evidence that the H5N1 virus circulating in parts of Asia has increased its pathogenicity in chickens and mice (a laboratory model for mammals), and has expanded its host range to include mammals, such as felines, not previously considered susceptible to infection.   Public health recommendations for affected countries   – Investigations of human cases should now include possible exposure to apparently healthy domestic ducks, as well as to diseased or dead poultry, as a risk factor for infection.   – Advice for people living in an affected area should be revised to include precautions for apparently healthy ducks similar to those for visibly ill poultry.   – Ducks should not be kept as pets or allowed to enter households.   – Water supplies for human use should not be drawn from open ponds used by domestic ducks and should be stored in ways that prevent contact with ducks.   – Once prepared and properly cooked , duck meat and eggs do not pose a risk to human health.   – Significant exposure can occur during home slaughtering and preparation prior to cooking, and these risks need to be addressed.   WHO, FAO, and OIE recognize that the altered role of domestic ducks in the transmission cycle of H5N1 should be addressed as it may complicate efforts to control the disease in poultry and prevent further human cases.   Research on the prevalence of asymptomatic infection in ducks in Asia is urgently needed. Such information will allow a focused approach to the prevention of human cases arising from exposure to apparently healthy domestic ducks.   The wider implications of the role played by domestic ducks are being jointly considered by FAO and OIE in formulating a long-term strategy for bringing the current outbreaks in poultry under control. With the H5N1 virus now endemic in parts of Asia, significant changes in farming practices may be needed to control the disease, especially in rural areas, and thus reduce opportunities for community-wide exposure.   In animals, surveillance remains the key to prevention and control, and this activity needs to be adequately supported.   FAO and OIE have recently issued comprehensive guidelines for responding to the outbreaks of H5N1 in poultry in Asia:   The two agencies are conducting research on the epidemiology of H5N1 infection in ducks and on the use of vaccination to control infection.   1 In the past, outbreaks of highly pathogenic avian influenza in poultry began following the primary introduction of a virus, of low pathogenicity, probably carried by a wild bird. The virus then required several months of circulation in domestic poultry in order to mutate from a form causing very mild disease to a form causing highly pathogenic disease, with a mortality approaching 100%. Only viruses of the H5 and H7 subtypes are capable of mutating to cause highly pathogenic disease. In the present outbreaks, however, asymptomatic domestic ducks can directly introduce the virus, in its highly pathogenic form, to poultry flocks.   2 Li KS, Wang J, Smith GJD et al.

Investigation of the case has identified exposure to diseased chickens as the most likely cause of infection. Following the death of chickens in the child’s household, she assisted in preparation of the birds for cooking, including the plucking of feathers.   WHO stresses the importance of educating populations in affected countries, especially those living in remote rural areas, about the danger of contact with diseased birds.   Since the beginning of this year, Thailand has reported 16 laboratory confirmed cases of H5N1 infection, of which 11 have been fatal. Four of these cases have occurred during the past four weeks.   Last week, Thai officials announced a probable case of human-to-human transmission in a family cluster of cases. Analysis of specimens from this cluster is presently under way at a WHO collaborating laboratory to determine whether the virus has changed its genetic make-up. Heightened surveillance for further cases has provided no evidence that efficient and sustained human-to-human transmission is presently occurring in Thailand.   Status of vaccine development for an influenza pandemic   A vaccine could reduce the high morbidity and mortality normally associated with influenza pandemics, if available sufficiently early. Significant efforts are needed to expedite vaccine development and thus take advantage of this preventive option.   Progress is needed on three fronts. First, countries experiencing outbreaks need to rapidly share human and animal viruses with laboratories in the WHO Global Influenza Surveillance Network. Analysis of these viruses determines the possible need for changes in the prototype vaccine “seed” strains which WHO makes available to the pharmaceutical industry.   Second, companies need to engage in research on pandemic vaccine development that includes pilot production of small batches for clinical testing. National licensing agencies in Europe and North America have developed regulatory guidelines for industry.   Third, public health agencies need to engage in discussions with pharmaceutical companies to explore areas of common interest in vaccine development and identify areas where support is needed. Since 2003, when two cases of human H5N1 infection occurred in Hong Kong SAR, WHO has worked to identify and resolve problems in order to pave the way for rapid development and production of a pandemic vaccine.   Vaccine manufacturers respond to market forces. Companies may be reluctant to produce a vaccine for an event, such as a pandemic, that cannot be predicted with any certainty and might not be caused by currently circulating strains. Some uncertainty has also centered on rights to use the special technique of reverse genetics, a patented procedure, that is needed to produce the prototype “seed” vaccine against H5N1.   At the beginning of April 2004, WHO made the prototype seed strain for an H5N1 vaccine available to manufacturers. To date, only two of the world’s roughly 12 major companies producing influenza vaccines have taken work on a pandemic vaccine significantly forward. These two companies, Aventis Pasteur Inc. and Chiron Corp., both located in the USA, have produced small batches of vaccine for use in clinical trials. These trials, which require several months for the compilation and analysis of data, are needed to fine-tune vaccine composition, test safety, and meet other licensing requirements. Trials are not expected to begin before year-end.  "
"2004","http://www.who.int/csr/don/2004_09_28a/en/index.html"," Avian influenza – situation in Thailand   28 September 2004   Two new cases confirmed   Since yesterday, the Ministry of Public Health in Thailand has confirmed two new cases of H5N1 avian influenza in humans. The cases are a 26-year-old woman, who died on 20 September, and her 32-year-old sister, who remains hospitalized in stable condition.   These new cases bring the total in Thailand confirmed since early September to three. Altogether, Thailand has reported 15 cases, of which 10 were fatal, since the first human cases were detected in January of this year.   Investigation of possible human-to-human transmission in a family cluster   The most recent cases are part of a family cluster of four cases under investigation to determine whether human-to-human transmission may have occurred. Immediate investigation of any possible human-to-human transmission is always needed to determine whether transmission has been efficient and sustained. Such a situation would be cause for alarm, as it might signal the start of an influenza pandemic. Inefficient, limited human-to-human transmission may occur on rare occasions and is in line with what is known, from epidemiological and laboratory investigations, about the possible behaviour of the H5N1 virus.   The initial case in the family cluster was an 11-year-old girl who died of pneumonia on 8 September. Thai authorities regard her as a probable case of H5N1; laboratory confirmation is not possible as no specimens from this patient are available for testing. The girl, who lived in the northern province of Kamphaeng Phet, resided with her 32-year-old aunt, whose infection has been confirmed. Both patients are known to have had contact with dead chickens.   The girl’s 26-year-old mother, whose infection is also now confirmed, resided in the Bangkok area, but provided bedside care for her daughter while hospitalized, up to the time of the child’s death. The mother fell ill upon her return to Bangkok, where she died on 20 September.   Thai officials have concluded that the mother could have acquired the infection either from some environmental source or while caring for her daughter, and that this represents a probable case of human-to-human transmission.   The family cluster also includes the 6-year-old son of the aunt of the initial case. He was hospitalized but is recovering, and samples are being tested.   Surveillance for additional cases, among health workers and in the wider community, has been greatly intensified in the province, and hospitals nationwide have been placed on heightened alert for further cases.   While the investigation of this family cluster provides evidence that human-to-human transmission may have occurred, evidence to date indicates that transmission of the virus among humans has been limited to family members and that no wider transmission in the community has occurred. Continued vigilance is needed to determine whether the epidemiological situation in humans remains stable.   Clinical samples taken from cases in the family cluster were immediately shared with a laboratory in the WHO Global Influenza Surveillance Network. Virus isolated from these samples will undergo genetic and antigenic analysis to determine whether the virus has evolved and, more specifically, whether it has acquired genes that allow improved transmissibility among humans.

WHO is issuing this alert to assist French authorities in tracing persons and their animals known or thought to have been in contact with the infected dog during the period when virus transmission is possible. The dog, accompanied by her owner was present at several public gatherings during a time when numerous tourists were visiting this part of France.   On 26 August 2004, the Pasteur Institute in Paris, France has confirmed that the dog was rabid. The dog, a four-month-old female, was acquired near Agadir, Morocco, in early July 2004 and illegally imported into France on 11 July 2004. The dog, which was neither registered nor vaccinated against rabies, showed initial clinical signs of illness on 18 August and died on 21 August.   The dog is described as of medium size, with medium-length hair of a brown-apricot colour, black muzzle, long tail, and drooping ears.   Transmission of rabies from this animal to humans and other animals could have occurred at any time from 2 August to 21 August. Several opportunities for exposure occurred. The dog’s owner, a resident of Bordeaux in the Gironde region, frequently took the dog for walks throughout the city, but most often in the neighbourhoods of Pont de Pierre, Bastide, quai de Queyries, the botanical gardens, and near the lake of Bordeaux. The owner also travelled with the dog to other parts of southwestern France as follows:   – on 2 August to Hostens (Gironde region) – on 5 August to the Mimos Festival in Périgueux (Dordogne region) – from 7 to 8 August to a street theatre festival in Miramont de Guyenne (Lot and Garonne region) – from 12 to 14 August to the Fest’Art music festival in Libourne (Gironde region).   Throughout the period from 2 to 21 August, the infected dog had several contacts with persons and dogs and is known to have bitten some persons. Several of these people have been identified and treated against rabies.   French authorities are now urgently seeking any additional persons and animals who may have been in contact with this dog during the infectious period. In particular, the authorities are seeking:   – a French-North African couple with two children (a boy and girl around the age of five) who played with the dog one night (date not known) after 21:00 in Bordeaux on the quai rive gauche; – a young lady speaking French with a Spanish accent who was walking near the lake of Bordeaux with her young daughter and a small white West Highland terrier dog on 10 or 11 August; – a cyclist, around 40 years old, who was chased by the dog on the docks of Garonne in front of the restaurant l’Estacade; – a couple, around 50 years old, who played with the dog near Lac Bleu in Léognan (Gironde).   Persons fitting this description are asked urgently to telephone this emergency number in Gironde: (+33) 5 56 90 60 00. Persons who believe their dog may have been in contact with the infected animal, involving licking, sniffing, playing, scratching, or bites, should contact a local veterinary service for an assessment of the risk.   Rabies, a viral disease, is invariably fatal in infected humans and animals. Vaccine administered shortly after exposure and immunoglobulin when required can prevent development of the disease.

"2004","http://www.who.int/csr/don/2004_08_25/en/index.html"," Avian influenza - update: Implications of H5N1 infections in pigs in China   25 August 2004   Considering the widespread nature of the current H5N1 outbreak in Asia and the capability of influenza viruses to jump the species barriers, it is inevitable that H5N1 virus will be detected in some pigs. Pigs can be infected with both avian and human influenza A viruses-for instance, human influenza H3N2 viruses have been detected in pigs in Asia, Europe and Africa.   Some of these human and avian influenza viruses might become adapted to pigs and then begin circulating in pig populations. The co-circulation of avian, human, and pig viruses in pigs is of significant concern because of the potential for a genetic exchange, or  reassortment,  of material between these viruses. Such an occurrence has the potential to produce a new, pandemic influenza strain.   Last week, a researcher at China's Harbin Veterinary Research Institute announced that pigs from farms in parts of China had been infected with the H5N1 strain of avian influenza (see previous report) . China's Ministry of Agriculture has since confirmed the researcher's findings. What is unclear from the few studies which have been conducted is whether the H5N1 virus has already become established in pig populations in China.   Because the findings remain preliminary and are not necessarily indicative for widespread infection among pigs, assessing the consequences of this information for public health is difficult. Providing a detailed risk assessment of the current situation requires an understanding of the main factors influencing the potential for the emergence of a pandemic influenza strain: the prevalence of H5N1 and human H3N2 virus in pigs in Asia, and the likelihood of a reassorted virus and its possible pathogenicity.   The role of pigs in genetic reassortment is not fully understood. While there has been no known natural occurrence of reassortment of influenza viruses in pigs that resulted in a new pandemic strain, the probability of this occurrence is not negligible.   The chances for genetic reassortment depend upon both the duration of H5N1 circulation in pigs as well as the simultaneous presence of human and pig influenza A viruses (such as H3N2 or H1N1). As long as human and avian influenza viruses are co-circulating - whether in humans or in pigs - the possibility of an exchange of genetic material-exists.   To better understand the implications of the findings in China, WHO is encouraging that additional studies be conducted on H5N1 and other influenza A viruses in pigs in China, as well as in other countries which have experienced H5N1 avian influenza outbreaks. In addition, laboratory experiments would be required to shed some light on the probability for virus reassortment, the possible pathogenicity of a reassorted virus, and the chance that pigs will act as a pathway for the emergence of a potential pandemic strain. These results will help national and international public health authorities not only to assess the role pigs and humans play in the emergence of a new influenza pandemic virus from H5N1, but to structure the necessary public health interventions.  "
"2004","http://www.who.int/csr/don/2004_08_20/en/index.html"," Avian influenza: H5N1 detected in pigs in China   20 August 2004   A researcher from China’s Harbin Veterinary Research Institute has today presented initial evidence that pigs from farms in parts of China have been infected with the H5N1 strain of avian influenza. The findings, set out in a table and without further supporting data, were presented today at an international symposium on SARS and avian influenza held in Beijing.   WHO has requested confirmation and further details about this study.   Pigs are known to be susceptible to infection with avian influenza viruses. However, natural infection of pigs with the H5N1 strain has not been previously reported.   In order to assess the implications for human health, it is important to know whether the reported infections in pigs are rare events, possibly caused by contact between pigs and wild birds. Wild aquatic birds, which are the natural reservoir of all influenza A viruses, can carry the H5N1 strain without developing symptoms, and are known to excrete large quantities of the virus in their faeces.   A comparison of the H5N1 strain isolated in pigs with strains recently circulating in poultry populations in parts of Asia is needed to determine whether the virus is being passed directly from poultry to pigs. Evidence of direct transmission of H5N1 from poultry to large numbers of pigs would be of particular concern, as this would increase opportunities for a new influenza virus with pandemic potential to emerge.   Pigs have been implicated in the emergence of new influenza viruses responsible for two of the previous century’s influenza pandemics. Pigs have receptors in their respiratory tract that make them susceptible to infection with human and avian influenza viruses. If a pig is simultaneously infected with both a human and an avian influenza virus, it can serve as a “mixing vessel”, facilitating the exchange of genetic material between the two viruses in a process known as “reassortment”. The resulting new virus, which will not be recognized by the human immune system, will have pandemic potential if it retains sufficient human genes to allow efficient human-to-human transmission, and if it causes severe disease in humans.   Confirmation of H5N1 infection in pigs would add complexity to the epidemiology of this disease, but needs to be viewed in perspective. During the peak of the poultry outbreak of H5N1 in Viet Nam earlier this year, extensive testing of pigs on farms where poultry were heavily infected failed to find evidence of infection in pigs. In addition, Hong Kong authorities regularly perform random testing for the H5 avian influenza virus subtype in pigs imported from mainland China. No infection in pigs has been detected to date.   WHO, in collaboration with FAO and OIE, will be assessing the implications of reported H5N1 infection in pigs as further details become available.  "

A HEV outbreak of similar characteristics has been confirmed among internally displaced people (IDP) in the Greater Darfur region, Sudan ( see previous report ).

Further testing is needed to determine whether the virus belongs to the same H5N1 strain that caused 22 cases, with 15 deaths, in Viet Nam and 12 cases, with 8 deaths, in Thailand earlier this year.   To date, H5N1 is the only strain of the H5 subtype known to jump directly from infected poultry to cause illness in humans.   Two of the fatal cases occurred in the northern Ha Tay province. The third case occurred in the southern province of Hau Giang. Staff from the WHO country office in Viet Nam will be meeting with the Ministry of Health tomorrow to gather further details about these cases and work out plans for addressing the situation. The government has today announced an initial series of measures aimed at controlling the disease in poultry and preventing further cases in humans.   WHO regards it as particularly important that viruses from these cases be made available for further analysis by laboratories in the WHO Global Influenza Surveillance Network. Further studies can help determine whether the virus has mutated and thus yield valuable information about the further evolution of the outbreak, the risks to humans, and the best preventive measures. Studies of the virus are also important in the further development, presently under way, of an effective human vaccine.   Thorough epidemiological and clinical investigation of these cases and their contacts is needed to improve understanding of the risks to humans.   Earlier this year, Viet Nam reported outbreaks of highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza in poultry in 57 of the country’s 64 provinces, resulting in the death or destruction of more than 43 million poultry. After a period of quiescence, Viet Nam reported fresh outbreaks in poultry in July in provinces in northern, central, and southern parts of the country. Outbreaks were also reported in July in China, Indonesia, and Thailand.   The confirmation of these latest human cases underscores the risk of virus transmission to humans from infected poultry. This risk will continue as long as outbreaks are occurring in poultry. Of greatest concern is the risk that continuing transmission of the virus to humans will give avian and influenza viruses an opportunity to exchange genes, potentially giving rise to a new virus with pandemic potential.

These cases were identified through the early warning alert and response system (EWAR) developed by WHO in collaboration with the Ministry of Health and other agencies. Hepatitis E virus (HEV) was confirmed by ELISA in 23 samples tested at the NAMRU3 laboratory in Cairo, Egypt. Suspected hepatitis cases have been reported from East, North and West Darfur but the highest incidence to date has been recorded in Morni IDP camp, West Darfur.   From a preliminary analysis of epidemiological data from the Morni IDP camp, a total of 149 cases and 8 deaths has been reported. 70% of the cases are female and the mean age is 24 years. Of the 8 deaths reported, 6 of them (75%) have occurred in pregnant women.   HEV is a waterborne disease usually transmitted by faecally contaminated water that can provoke major outbreaks in settings with poor sanitation. Refugees and IDPs residing in overcrowded camps are at highest risk of disease. Case fatality rates can vary from 1 to 4%, but may be as high as 20% in pregnant women who are more susceptible to severe forms of the disease.   This outbreak is a consequence of the inadequate and unsafe water supply and poor sanitary conditions the Darfur population has experienced during this crisis. Despite important efforts by international organizations, existing resources are insufficient to cover the basic needs of the IDPs. Without an immediate improvement in access to safe, clean water and better sanitation in these camps, the disease could spread rapidly and lead to increased mortality.   UNICEF is working with the federal and state ministries of health and nongovernmental organizations to increase the quality and quantity of water supply. Measures to improve sanitation include health promotion activities, safe handling of food, safe disposal of excreta and distribution of soap, which is supported by the United Nations Logistics Centre.   Additional field investigations are planned in order to focus current outbreak control measures, to better understand the epidemiology of HEV transmission in IDP and refugee camps and to elaborate specific recommendations for prevention and control of future HEV epidemics in such settings.

"2004","http://www.who.int/csr/don/2004_08_07/en/index.html"," WHO announces end of Ebola outbreak in southern Sudan   7 August 2004   Press release   Geneva - Today marks the 42nd day since the last person identified as infected with Ebola haemorrhagic fever died on 26 June 2004 in Yambio Hospital, southern Sudan. As 42 days is twice the maximum incubation period for Ebola, and as no further cases have been identified, WHO declares today that the outbreak in southern Sudan is over.    The rapid containment of this outbreak was a tremendous success for the health authorities, WHO, and the international community involved in the control operations,  said Dr Abdullah Ahmed, head of WHO, southern Sudan, and coordinator of the response.   As of today, the health authorities of Yambio County have reported a total of 17 cases, including seven deaths from Ebola. Ebola haemorrhagic fever is a febrile illness which causes death in 50-90% of all clinically ill cases. It is transmitted by direct contact with the blood, secretions, organs or bodily fluids of infected persons.    In Yambio, WHO and our partners were able to apply lessons learned during responses to the five Ebola outbreaks that have occurred since 2000,  said Dr Pierre Formenty, who worked as part of WHO's response team. Ebola outbreaks have been detected more frequently in recent years, making local and international collaboration essential.   During this outbreak, Ebola virus (sub-type Sudan) was confirmed by laboratory tests at the Kenya Medical Research Institute and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the United States. When the outbreak was first reported in late May, a response team including members from WHO southern Sudan Early Warning and Response Network (EWARN), and WHO headquarters was formed to work with local health authorities in creating a Crisis Committee to control the outbreak.   The committee included UNICEF, Médecins Sans Frontières-France and other non-governmental organizations and churches working in public health. The international response to the outbreak also included partners from WHO's Regional Office for the Eastern Mediterranean, the Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network (GOARN) as well as experts from the CDC, the European Programme for Intervention Epidemiology Training, Field Epidemiology Training Programme, Egypt and the Health Protection Agency in the United Kingdom.   Intensive social mobilization for Ebola was essential to the outbreak's containment. Key messages about the disease and behaviour-specific precautionary advice were passed on to the people in and around Yambio by local community advocates.    Once the people of Yambio were convinced of the very real risks Ebola posed and they understood what they could do to protect themselves and their families the outbreak response was greatly accelerated,  said Ms Asiya Odugleh from the WHO Mediterranean Centre for Vulnerability Reduction, Tunis, who assisted the county social mobilization team.   The control efforts included, for example, an isolation ward at Yambio Hospital with a low fence so that patients were effectively isolated, yet still able to see and talk to their family and friends over the fence at a safe distance. Such simple adaptations of disease control measures made it easier for families to accept the case management of patients in the isolation unit, while ensuring maximum protection for the medical team and patients.    The lessons we learned in Yambio from this outbreak will strengthen our responses to future outbreaks,  said Dr Hassan El Bushra from the WHO Regional Office for the Eastern Mediterranean in Cairo. The Yambio experience has proven the value of rapid outbreak detection, local response capacities, active community involvement, and the coordination of specialized international assistance to the outbreak's containment.    WHO cannot predict where or when the next Ebola outbreak will happen,  said Dr El Bushra,  But we can continue laying the groundwork by building on what we have learned in Yambio.

"2004","http://www.who.int/csr/don/2004_07_30/en/index.html"," Avian Influenza - Assessment of the current situation   30 July 2004   After a period of quiescence in Southeast Asia, outbreaks of highly pathogenic avian influenza (A/H5N1) are again being reported in chickens and ducks in China, Indonesia, Thailand and Viet Nam. In Thailand, outbreaks have been reported in 21 of 76 provinces; and in Viet Nam outbreaks were reported in the northern, central and southern parts of the country. These outbreaks, many without apparent epidemiological links to each other, suggest A/H5N1 is now widely prevalent and is very likely to have become endemic.   The outbreaks in birds pose a significant threat to human health.   As WHO has stated since the first A/H5N1 outbreaks were reported, this virus has the potential to ignite a global influenza pandemic in humans. In a number of these outbreaks since the beginning of 2004, the virus has jumped from infected chickens or ducks directly to humans. These direct human infections have produced severe and sometimes fatal outcomes. WHO's continuing concern is that this virus may reassort its genes with those from a human influenza virus, thereby acquiring the ability to move easily from human to human and thus triggering a pandemic.   Recent media reports have occasionally suggested the presence of new human cases of A/H5N1. WHO has received no information substantiating these reports.   At a meeting in Bangkok which ended today, the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), in association with the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE) and WHO, announced plans to launch a new regional veterinary influenza network. WHO welcomes this initiative as this network aims to strengthen surveillance in animals and should provide more rapid diagnosis of the disease.   The FAO/OIE regional animal laboratory network will closely link with the WHO's global influenza programme to allow for more rapid sharing of virus samples. Faster and broader sharing of samples will enable WHO to monitor for changes in the virus which could diminish the effectiveness of the human vaccine currently under development. To date, such sample exchanges have been retarded in some affected countries.   The risk of emergence of a new human pandemic virus will remain as long as the avian influenza virus exists in the environment. Without significant increase in control efforts at national and international levels, it may be years before the virus is eradicated. While these control efforts continue, WHO reemphasizes the need to monitor the health of people on these front lines. Thus, WHO-coordinated preparedness activities will continue and WHO encourages members states to start or continue with their own influenza pandemic preparedness plans.  "
"2004","http://www.who.int/csr/don/2004_07_16/en/index.html"," Avian Influenza - Necessary precautions to prevent human infection of H5N1, need for virus sharing   16 July 2004   WHO continues to be concerned by the simultaneous outbreaks of Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza H5N1 in several Asian countries. Avian influenza - Current evaluation of risks to humans from H5N1 following recent reports   While these outbreaks thus far remain restricted to poultry populations, they nevertheless increase the chances of virus transmission and human infection of the disease, as well as the possible emergence of a new influenza virus strain capable of sparking a global pandemic.   In this context, WHO re-emphasizes the necessity of protecting individuals involved in the culling of H5N1-infected poultry. Workers who might be exposed to H5N1-infected poultry should have proper personal protective equipment (i.e. protective clothing, masks and goggles) since there is a high risk of exposure during the slaughtering process.   In addition to the use of personal protective equipment, WHO is recommending:   To avoid the co-infection of avian and human influenza, which could allow for the emergence of a pandemic influenza virus, all persons involved in mass culling operations, transportation and burial/incineration of carcasses should be vaccinated with the current WHO-recommended influenza vaccine.   All persons exposed to infected poultry or to farms under suspicion should be under close monitoring by local health authorities. National authorities should also increase their surveillance of any reported clusters of influenza or influenza-like illness.   Antiviral treatment should be available on an on-going basis for treatment of a suspected human infection with a Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza virus. If antivirals are available in sufficient quantities, prophylactic use should be considered.   Please see the full list of WHO's interim recommendations for the protection of persons involved in the mass slaughter of animals potentially infected with Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza viruses.   WHO is also urging countries to work on standardized procedures for immediate sharing of all avian influenza virus strains responsible for outbreaks with WHO's international network of laboratories   WHO is depending on the continued collaboration of the national health and agricultural services to establish routine procedures for immediate sharing of avian influenza virus samples. Without such virus samples, WHO will not be in a position to provide proper vaccine prototype strains and related guidance for vaccine producers.  "

"2004","http://www.who.int/csr/don/2004_07_08/en/index.html"," Avian influenza - Current evaluation of risks to humans from H5N1 following recent reports   8 July 2004   Avian influenza home page   In the last two weeks, avian influenza appears to have re-emerged in poultry in several countries in Asia. These outbreaks could either be new outbreaks of Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza A(H5N1) virus or a continuation of the outbreaks first reported earlier in the year. These events, in addition to two new research reports -- about the virus becoming increasingly pathogenic and becoming more widespread in birds in the region -- fuel the World Health Organization's concern about the threat the virus poses to human health.   WHO has been concerned about this virus, influenza A(H5N1), because of its threat to humans both in farm settings in Asia and its greater, potentially global risk. Several countries in Asia have witnessed this virus crossing the species barrier, moving from infected chickens or ducks directly into humans in three documented outbreaks since 1997. These direct human infections have produced severe and sometimes fatal outcomes. Moreover, the virus has the potential to acquire the ability to spread easily from human to human, and thus, trigger a global influenza pandemic.   Now, two research reports have added to our understanding of this virus. First, members of China's Ministry of Agriculture and colleagues reported in a paper published last week in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences that the virus appears to be widespread in domestic ducks in southern China. Further, the scientists found that the virus is causing increasingly severe disease. However, these trials were done in mice and may not have a direct implication for humans.   This week, the journal Nature published a report which indicates domestic and wild birds in the region may have contributed to the increasing spread of the virus and suggests that the virus is gaining a stronger foothold in the region. These observations suggest that control of the virus may be even more difficult than thought in the spring.   Effective risk management tools exist to control outbreaks of influenza A(H5N1) when they are detected in poultry operations. China, for example, was quick to employ these tools last week when an outbreak was discovered in Anhui province. These risk management measures include the culling of infected and exposed birds, stringent biosecurity measures and vaccination. While this approach can still take months or even years to contain the virus completely, these methods have been effective in the past.   However, tools to assess the risk to human health are less well developed. While recent reports indicate the virus has been present consistently in the environment for the last several years, it has still not acquired the ability to infect humans easily. Why? Is there something about this virus which resists this development? Given the recent reports, WHO urges and offers assistance that such risk assessment activities, including surveillance in animals and humans, and strain analysis, be undertaken as soon as possible.   More knowledge of the virus could be acquired if WHO had full access to all virus isolates and clinical specimens from recent outbreaks. All H5N1 viruses are not the same, and how they differ could provide important insights. For example, the work reported in Nature suggests that the Indonesian avian influenza virus, while belonging to the genotype of viruses seen in Viet Nam and Thailand, is also distinct. What, if any, impact does this difference have? With this information, public health planners would know that they are confronting the same virus in all of the recent outbreaks in Asia. This is another set of the many questions that need to be answered imperatively.   Pandemic preparedness activities started by WHO in the wake of the outbreaks reported earlier this year continue. Less than two weeks ago, WHO hosted a meeting in Kuala Lumpur with experts from 13 countries and areas of the Asia-Pacific region. Among other activities, the meeting participants were provided with a WHO preparedness self-assessment tool. WHO is collaborating with scientists and the pharmaceutical community on a global surveillance system to monitor changes in the virus's susceptibility to known antivirals. Finally, pandemic vaccine development continues. Two vaccine manufacturers, both based in the United States, have produced a supply of trial vaccine which will be tested for safety and efficacy in humans.   In summary, recent developments suggest that: • the virus is more widespread than previously thought and found in wild birds, and therefore it may be more difficult to eliminate. • virus isolates and specimens from all recent outbreaks need to be shared with the WHO laboratory network to monitor the circulating viruses and to assess the adequacy of the current pandemic vaccine strain. • as control measures are strengthened, national governments are encouraged to provide human influenza vaccinations to culling workers. • all people, especially culling workers, exposed to infected birds need to be provided with antivirals. • human trials of experimental influenza pandemic vaccines should be accelerated. • while early identification of avian influenza cases in humans is difficult, stepped up surveillance for the early detection of the disease in humans is essential.   The risk of emergence of a new human pandemic virus will remain as long as the avian influenza virus exists in the environment. WHO's concern and activities continue at a high level following recent reports. Because the H5N1 threat is unlikely to be resolved in the shortterm, WHO is working with other international agencies, including the Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO), and World Organization for Animal Health (OIE), to monitor events.

Two researchers at the Institute developed SARS in late March and mid-April. The outbreak was reported on April 22 and the Institute was closed a day later.   Preliminary findings in the investigation have yet to identify a single infectious source or single procedural error at the Institute – and it is conceivable that an exact answer may never be determined. Neither of the researchers is known to have directly conducted experiments using live SARS coronavirus. However, investigators have serious concerns about biosafety procedures at the Institute – including how and where procedures using SARS coronavirus were carried out, and how and where SARS coronavirus samples were stored.   WHO and Chinese authorities view with concern the occurrence of laboratory-associated SARS cases. WHO urges all Member States to view this latest outbreak as an opportunity to review the biosafety practices of institutions and laboratories working with SARS coronavirus.   During and after the SARS outbreak of 2003, a large number of specimens were collected from possible human cases, animals and the environment. These specimens, which may contain live SARS coronavirus, are still kept in various laboratories around the world. Some of them are stored in laboratories at an inappropriate containment level. SARS coronavirus has also been propagated in reference and research laboratories, and distributed to other laboratories for research purposes. Research using live and inactivated SARS coronavirus – and other pathogens capable of causing serious illness -- is being conducted in many laboratories.   WHO has issued the following laboratory safety guidelines and recommendations:   • WHO biosafety guidelines for handling of SARS specimens (25 April 2003)   • Summary of the discussion and recommendations of the SARS laboratory workshop of 22 October 2003   • WHO post-outbreak biosafety guidelines for handling of SARS coronavirus specimens and cultures (18 December 2003)   In these guidelines, WHO strongly recommends Biosafety Level 3 (BSL 3) as the minimum containment level to work with live SARS coronavirus. WHO also urges Member States to maintain a thorough inventory of laboratories working with and/or storing live SARS coronavirus and to ensure that necessary biosafety standards are in place.   WHO commends the Chinese authorities for taking swift action to contain the latest outbreak once it was recognized and reported, by way of extensive contact tracing and the quarantine and medical observation of such individuals. Once again, it has been demonstrated that SARS is a containable disease.  "

The institute is known to have conducted experiments using the live SARS coronavirus during February and March.   Two researchers at the institute developed SARS in late March and mid-April. However, neither is known to have conducted research using the live virus, suggesting some other source of infection within the laboratory or possibly elsewhere.   Members of a joint WHO-Chinese investigative team, wearing full personal protective equipment, entered the institute last Friday and again yesterday. Initial findings indicate that the investigation will be complex, as no single infectious source or single procedural error appears likely to explain infection in the two researchers.   Continuing investigation is needed to determine the source of infection and ensure that conditions, equipment, and biosafety procedures within the institute do not pose an ongoing risk of contracting SARS infection. A large number of samples were taken, by Chinese investigators, from various locations in the institute. These samples are also undergoing analysis at the WHO SARS laboratory in Hong Kong.   WHO has strongly recommended that work using the live SARS virus be conducted in biosafety level 3 facilities in order to minimize the risk of laboratory-acquired infections. Further investigation of the institute is needed to ensure that any work using the live virus fully complies with the strict requirements for physical containment of the virus, storage, administrative control, work procedures, personal protection of laboratory workers, and authorization and monitoring of all staff admitted to the laboratory.   The National Institute of Virology was closed on 23 April and most of its staff were quarantined for medical observation. However, a small number of staff have remained within the facility to continue essential experiments and care for laboratory animals.  "

The woman, a medical doctor, was the mother of a 26-year-old postgraduate student who had been conducting research at the National Institute of Virology in Beijing. The student remains hospitalized in Anhui.   Since the first case was reported on 22 April, Chinese authorities have confirmed a diagnosis of SARS in five persons (see summary below). Testing continues on another four patients who have SARS-like symptoms and a history of close contact with a known case.   Since 22 April, the seven patients in Beijing are now being treated in isolation in a single facility, Ditan Hospital, as a risk reduction strategy.   Investigation of the source of the outbreak is presently focused on lapses in biosafety procedures at the National Institute of Virology. The institute was closed on 23 April and its staff were placed in isolation.   Summary of cases   To date, there have been three generations resulting in nine cases.   First generation. The first case is a 26-year-old female postgraduate student from Anhui Province. She worked at the National Institute of Virology in Beijing 7–22 March. Laboratories at the institute are known to be conducting studies using the live SARS coronavirus. Her symptoms developed on 25 March in Anhui. Following onset of symptoms, she travelled twice by train from Anhui to Beijing and back to Anhui. Her SARS infection has been confirmed by the Chinese Ministry of Health. She is presently hospitalized in isolation in Anhui.   A second case who may have acquired infection from a laboratory source is a 31-year-old male researcher at the same virology institute. His symptoms developed on 17 April. He is presently undergoing treatment in isolation at Beijing’s Ditan Hospital. To date, he has not been linked to any other cases.   Second generation. The two cases in the second generation are both linked to close personal contact with the postgraduate student. These cases are her 53-year-old mother, whose infection with the SARS coronavirus was confirmed by Chinese authorities today. She is, to date, the only fatal case in the outbreak. The second case is a 20-year-old nurse in Beijing who treated the postgraduate student, from 29 March to 2 April, during her initial hospitalization in Beijing The nurse’s SARS infection has been confirmed by the Chinese Ministry of Health. She is being treated in isolation at Beijing’s Ditan Hospital.   Third generation. Five further cases have all been linked to close contact with the nurse. Three are relatives: her 45-year-old father, her 44-year-old mother, and a 36-year-old aunt. SARS infection in the mother and aunt has been confirmed by the Chinese Ministry of Health. The fourth case linked to the nurse is a 49-year-old retired female doctor who was admitted to hospital because of another illness and shared a room with the nurse. The retired doctor’s 23-year-old daughter-in-law, who accompanied her at the time of hospital admission, is the fifth case. As both women did not develop SARS-like symptoms until a week following hospital admission, both are presumed to have acquired their infection from close contact with the nurse.   All five patients are being treated in isolation at Ditan Hospital.  "

Confirmation is based on the results of laboratory tests, clinical symptoms, and a history of close contact with a known case.   Both patients are relatives – the mother and an aunt – of a 20-year-old nurse who treated what is thought to be the index case in the outbreak. The nurse subsequently developed respiratory symptoms and was hospitalized on 7 April. She was visited the next day by family members, including the mother and aunt.   The 44-year-old mother is now in critical condition. The 36-year-old aunt, who was diagnosed with bilateral pneumonia earlier this week, remains in stable condition.

The number of SARS cases either clinically confirmed or under investigation remains nine: seven in Beijing and two (including the single fatality) in Anhui Province.   In Beijing, all seven SARS cases are now being treated in isolation at Ditan Hospital. This is a risk reduction strategy aimed at preventing further spread through the hospital system.   According to WHO guidelines for the global surveillance of SARS, classification as a confirmed case at the start of an outbreak requires independent verification of results by an external international reference laboratory.

"2004","http://www.who.int/csr/don/2004_04_28/en/index.html"," China reports additional SARS case - update 3   28 April 2004   Chinese health authorities have today announced that an additional case of SARS is under investigation. This brings the total number of cases in China, reported since 22 April, to nine. Of these, one has died.   The new case, in Beijing, is a 49-year-old female retired doctor. On 12 April, she was admitted to the same hospital ward where a 20-year-old nurse was being treated for pneumonia. The former doctor began developing SARS-like symptoms on 19 April and on 22 April was transferred to Ditan Hospital and placed in isolation. Her condition is listed as critical.   The 20-year-old nurse, previously reported to WHO as a confirmed case, has been linked to an additional five cases. These include the one reported today and four reported on Sunday. To date, all cases have been linked to chains of transmission involving close contact with an identified case. The second confirmed case, who remains hospitalized in Anhui Province, is a 26-year-old postgraduate student who had been conducting research at the National Institute of Virology in Beijing. She is thought to be the index case in the present outbreak.   During the 2003 outbreak, the transmission of SARS was greatly amplified in hospital settings. As a risk reduction strategy in Beijing, all seven SARS cases are now being treated in Ditan Hospital.   However, patients were treated or assessed in open wards at seven hospitals (five in Beijing and 2 in Anhui) before suspicions of SARS were raised and procedures of isolation and infection control were introduced. In addition, the two patients in Anhui travelled long distances within China by train.   As these events created opportunities for multiple exposures, Chinese authorities have undertaken extensive tracing and follow-up of contacts. In Beijing, nearly 700 persons have been isolated or placed in quarantine.   The maximum incubation period for SARS is generally accepted to be 10 days. Based on present knowledge about the disease, persons exposed to the virus are not infectious prior to the onset of symptoms. For these reasons, rapid detection and isolation of cases, and rapid tracing and follow-up of contacts have been successfully used to bring a SARS outbreak under control.   Investigation of the outbreak   Following a request by the Chinese Ministry of Health, the initial members of a WHO team are now in Beijing to assist in the investigation and control of the outbreaks there and in Anhui. Investigation of the source of infection will initially focus on biosafety procedures at the National Institute of Virology in Beijing. Two of the nine cases reported by China, including the earliest case, were researchers at the institute, which has been conducting work using the live SARS coronavirus.   Chinese authorities are providing WHO with detailed clinical and epidemiological information on all cases. This information is important in assessing the severity of illness caused by the virus and the extent of its transmission. Of the 8 patients currently hospitalized for treatment, the patient in Anhui Province continues to improve. In Beijing, two patients are in critical condition and the others remain under treatment for pneumonia.   If the source of infection is determined to come from the National Institute of Virology in Beijing, this will be the first SARS outbreak caused by a laboratory-acquired virus, which could possibly cause different patterns of illness and transmission. Previous laboratory-associated cases – a single case each in Singapore in September 2003 and in Taiwan, China in December 2003 – did not result in any further transmission. Both cases fully recovered.   In addition, four cases (3 confirmed and 1 probable) were reported in Guangdong Province in December 2003 and January 2004, presumably acquired from an environmental source. Unlike the present outbreak, these cases were associated with mild illness only and did not result in secondary transmission to others.  "
"2004","http://www.who.int/csr/don/2004_04_26/en/index.html"," Additional patients in China under investigation for SARS; WHO team travels to Beijing - update 2   26 April 2004   At the request of the Chinese Ministry of Health, WHO is today sending the first members of an international team to help investigate the source of SARS cases recently reported in Beijing and the eastern province of Anhui. The team, which is expected to begin work on Wednesday, will include experts in epidemiology, virology, infection control, and laboratory biosafety.   Results of investigations to date point to laboratory research at the National Institute of Virology in Beijing as the likely source of the outbreak. The institute has been engaged in research with the SARS coronavirus, including the development of a vaccine.   Two of the recently reported cases were conducting research at the laboratory: a 26-year-old female postgraduate student from Anhui Province, and a 31-year-old man. The dates of symptom onset in the two cases are widely separated (23 days), suggesting that more than one opportunity for exposure may have occurred in the laboratory from mid-March through early April.   Authorities have closed the virology institute and placed its more than 200 employees under medical observation. Numerous environmental samples from the laboratory have been taken to help assess possible sources of contamination, and these samples will be shared with WHO.   Understanding and eliminating the source of infection are critical steps in bringing the outbreak under control. An equally important activity is to quickly detect all chains of transmission and interrupt them through rapid case detection, tracing and follow-up of contacts, and infection control in hospitals.   WHO is concerned about additional opportunities for exposure that may have already occurred. Some patients were treated or assessed in several different hospitals before a suspicion of SARS led to the introduction of adequate precautionary measures, including isolation of patients and strict procedures for infection control. One patient travelled a long distance twice by train within China while symptomatic.   Chinese authorities have heightened surveillance and reporting for SARS-like illness in health care facilities and have sent investigative teams to Anhui Province.   Since 22 April, China has reported that eight persons have been clinically diagnosed as SARS cases or are under investigation for possible SARS infection. Six of these are in Beijing and two, including the single fatality, are in Anhui Province. As of today, close to 1000 contacts of these cases are under medical observation, including 640 in Beijing and 353 in Anhui.   The most recent cases, announced on Sunday, are four close contacts of a 20-year-old nurse who treated the Anhui student at a Beijing hospital. The cases – all in Beijing – are currently under investigation. They include the nurse’s mother, father, aunt, and a woman who shared a hospital ward with the nurse when she was undergoing treatment. Onset of symptoms for all four persons occurred between 16 and 19 April. The nurse’s mother is in serious condition following the development of pneumonia. The other three persons are in stable condition.   In addition, health authorities have reported that two doctors who treated the postgraduate student during her hospitalization in Hefai, Anhui, have developed fever. A person in close contact with one of the doctors has also developed fever.   To date, all diagnosed cases and cases under investigation have been linked to chains of transmission involving close personal contact with an identified case. There is no evidence of wider transmission in the community.   According to WHO guidelines for the global surveillance of SARS, classification as a confirmed case at the start of an outbreak requires independent verification of results by an external international reference laboratory. Such procedures are considered necessary in view of the implications that confirmed SARS cases can have for international public health.  "

These are the 20-year-old nurse in Beijing, reported yesterday, who remains in intensive care, and a 26-year-old female laboratory researcher, from Anhui Province. During two weeks in March, the researcher worked at the Chinese National Institute of Virology in Beijing, which is part of China’s Center for Disease Control. This institute is known to be engaged in research involving the SARS coronavirus. She developed symptoms on 25 March and was attended, while in a Beijing hospital, by the nurse. Her mother also provided bedside care.   The mother became ill in Anhui on 8 April and died on 19 April. Her clinical symptoms were compatible with SARS, and health authorities have retrospectively diagnosed her as a suspected SARS case.   The fourth person is a 31-year-old male laboratory researcher who also worked at the Beijing virology institute. He developed symptoms on 17 April and was hospitalized in isolation on 22 April. Health authorities have diagnosed him as a suspected SARS case.   In line with WHO definitions of SARS coronavirus infections, WHO has classified two of these persons, the 20-year-old nurse and the 26-year-old laboratory researcher, as probable cases of SARS. The two additional persons remain under investigation; further laboratory tests are being conducted by Chinese authorities.   According to WHO guidelines for the global surveillance of SARS, classification as a confirmed case requires independent verification of results by an external international reference laboratory. Such procedures are considered necessary in view of the implications that confirmed SARS cases can have for international public health.

As her condition did not improve, she was transferred on 14 April to a second Beijing hospital, where she was placed in intensive care. Results of initial blood tests, received today, indicate a likely infection with the SARS coronavirus. However, further testing is needed before a diagnosis of SARS can be confirmed.   Contact tracing has identified 171 contacts, who have been placed under observation. Of these, five have developed fever.   If confirmed, this will be the first case of SARS since January this year, when authorities in Guangdong Province confirmed infection in a 35-year-old businessman and a 20-year-old waitress. Following the end of the SARS outbreak, announced by WHO on 5 July 2003, five SARS cases have been confirmed. Two occurred in laboratory workers, in Singapore and Taiwan, China, and three in Guangdong Province. The third Guangdong case, in a 32-year-old television journalist, was announced in December 2003. None of these five cases resulted in further transmission of the virus.   China, which experienced the largest number of SARS cases during the 2003 outbreak, has a well-developed system for the detection and investigation of possible cases of SARS.

On 13 March, he may have been accidentally exposed in the eye. On 16 March, the individual reported conjunctivitis and nasal discharge. Treatment with oseltamavir, an antiviral drug active against influenza A viruses, began on 18 March. On 30 March, Health Canada concluded that this case was caused by avian influenza A(H7). Health Canada informed WHO of this case on 31 March. The patient's symptoms have fully resolved.   On 2 April, WHO was informed by Health Canada of a second poultry worker in British Columbia identified with avian influenza A(H7). This worker developed conjunctivitis in March 25 after close contact with infected birds. He was treated with oseltamivir on 25 March and his symptoms resolved.   Based on this epidemiological information provided by Health Canada, the World Health Organization today raised the global pandemic preparedness level from 0.1 to 0.2 for the Canadian outbreak.   Global pandemic preparedness levels are dictated by the epidemiological situation for each local event. Level 0.2 means that more than one human case caused by a new subtype of influenza virus has been identified in the local event.   In Asia, another avian influenza virus, A(H5N1), has been responsible for 34 reported human illnesses and 23 deaths. The existing global preparedness level of 0.2 for the avian influenza in Asia remains unchanged.   Preparedness levels have been organized into a matrix established by WHO in 1999( WHO Influenza Pandemic Preparedness plan ). When a preparedness level is raised to 0.2, affected countries are advised to step up their surveillance in persons exposed to affected poultry, to organize special investigations to better understand the new virus, to advise persons at risk to wear protected clothing, and to consider the use of antivirals and normal human influenza vaccine.   WHO has been informed that Canada has taken all required actions in response to the current avian influenza A(H7) outbreak in British Columbia.   The new pandemic preparedness level for avian influenza A(H7) also means that WHO will begin a series of activities to obtain the virus, characterize it, and assess the needs for diagnostics and vaccine development.

"2004","http://www.who.int/csr/don/2004_03_02/en/index.html"," Avian influenza A(H5N1)- update 31: Situation (poultry) in Asia: need for a long-term response, comparison with previous outbreaks   2 March 2004   During last week’s emergency meeting in Bangkok, Thailand, officials from FAO, OIE, and WHO drew attention to several unique features of the current outbreaks of H5N1 in poultry in Asia, in particular its geographical distribution, rate of spread and severity of which are unprecedented.   Prospects for rapid control are inconsistent with worldwide experience, over more than four decades, with previous outbreaks, which have all been much smaller in scope and inherently less challenging. Even in countries with good surveillance, adequate resources, and geographically limited outbreaks, control has often taken up to two years. For these reasons and others, WHO has cautioned against assumptions that the outbreaks can be controlled in the immediate future.   WHO has described the serious public health implications of these outbreaks in a previous update .   Up to the end of 2003, highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) was considered a rare disease. Since 1959, only 21 Outbreaks had been reported worldwide. The majority occurred in Europe and the Americas. Of the total, only five resulted in significant spread to numerous farms, and only one was associated with spread to other countries.   Since mid-December 2003, eight Asian countries have confirmed outbreaks of highly pathogenic avian influenza caused by the H5N1 strain. Most of these countries are experiencing outbreaks of this disease for the first time in their histories. In several, outbreaks have been detected in virtually every part of the country   Over the past two months, more than 100 million birds have either died of the disease or been culled in Asia. This figure is greater than the total number of poultry affected, over years, in the world’s previous five largest outbreaks combined.   Worldwide experience since 1959 supports official statements about the unprecedented nature of the present situation and the challenges for control. Unique features in the present situation include:   - Concentration of poultry in backyard farms. In several countries experiencing outbreaks, up to 80% of poultry are produced on small farms and backyard holdings in rural areas, where poultry range freely. In China, 60% of the country’s esitmated 13.2 billion chickens are raised on small farms in close proximity to humans and domestic animals, including pigs. This situation makes implementation of strict control measures, essential to the control of previous outbreaks, extremely difficult. These control measures – including bird-proof, ecologically controlled housing, treatment of water supplies, disinfection of all incoming persons, equipment, and vehicles, prevention of contact with insects, rodents, and other mechanical vectors – cannot be applied on small rural farms and backyard holdings.   – Economic significance of poultry production. Poultry production contributes greatly to the economies and food supplies of affected countries. The agricultural sector faces the challenge of minimizing losses to industry and subsistence farmers in ways that also reduce health risks for humans. Because many people in the region are so dependent on poultry, appropriate culling may be difficult to implement.   – Lack of control experience. Since the disease is new to most countries in the region, very little experience exists at national and international levels to guide the best country-specific control measures. In some countries, announcements of successful culling in certain areas are being followed by subsequent eruptions of disease in the same areas, suggesting reintroduction of the virus, continuing presence in the environment, or inadequate verification of outbreak control.   – Lack of resources. Several countries with very widespread outbreaks lack adequate infrastructure and resources, including resources to compensate farmers and thus encourage compliance with government recommendations. In some countries that have announced outbreaks, neither surveillance to detect the extent of spread nor culling of animals known to be infected is taking place.   – The scale of international spread. With so many adjacent countries affected, a region-wide strategy will be needed to ensure that gains in one country are not compromised by inadequate control in another.   These unique features will make rapid control and long-term prevention of recurrence extremely difficult to achieve.   Culling remains the first line of action, as recommended by FAO, OIE, and WHO, for bringing the current outbreaks under control. Unlike other economically important domestic animals, poultry raising takes place in a very short production system. Provided sufficient resources are available to replace culled poultry stock, countries should not postpone aggressive culling because of fears of long-term consequences on poultry production.   Wild birds can play a role in introducing a virus of low pathogenicity into domestic flocks where, if allowed to circulate for several months, it can mutate into a highly pathogenic form. No evidence to date indicates that wild birds are the source of the present outbreaks of highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza. Wild birds should not be culled.   Previous outbreaks of highly pathogenic avian influenza worldwide Year  Country/area  Domestic birds affected  Strain  1959  Scotland  chicken  H5N1  1963  England  turkey  H7N3  1966  Ontario (Canada)  turkey  H5N9  1976  Victoria (Australia)  chicken  H7N7  1979  Germany  chicken  H7N7  1979  England  turkey  H7N7  19831985  Pennsylvania (USA)*  chicken, turkey  H5N2  1983  Ireland  turkey  H5N8  1985  Victoria (Australia)  chicken  H7N7  1991  England  turkey  H5N1  1992  Victoria (Australia)  chicken  H7N3  1994  Queensland (Australia)  chicken  H7N3  19941995  Mexico*  chicken  H5N2  1994  Pakistan*  chicken  H7N3  1997  New South Wales (Australia)  chicken  H7N4  1997  Hong Kong (China)*  chicken  H5N1  1997  Italy  chicken  H5N2  19992000  Italy*  turkey  H7N1  2002  Hong Kong (China)  chicken  H5N1  2002  Chile  chicken  H7N3  2003  Netherlands*  chicken  H7N7    *Outbreaks with significant spread to numerous farms, resulting in great economic losses. Most other outbreaks involved little or no spread from the initially infected farms.   Observations from previous outbreaks (1959–2003)   Outbreaks of highly pathogenic avian influenza can be extremely difficult to control, even under favourable conditions (concentration of infected birds in well-maintained commercial production facilities, limited geographical occurrence). – The 1983 Pennsylvania (USA) outbreak took two years to control. Some 17 million birds were destroyed at a direct cost of US$62 million. Indirect costs have been estimated at more than US$250 million. – The 2003 outbreak in the Netherlands spread to Belgium and Germany. In the Netherlands, more than 30 million birds - a quarter of the country’s poultry stock – were destroyed. Some 2.7 million were destroyed in Belgium, and around 400,000 in Germany. In the Netherlands, 89 humans were infected, of whom one (a veterinarian) died. In that outbreak, measures needed to protect the health of poultry workers, farmers, and persons visiting farms included wearing of protective clothing, masks to cover the mouth and nose, eye protection, vaccination against normal seasonal human influenza, and administration of prophylactic antiviral drugs.   Control is even more difficult in countries with dense poultry populations. – The Italian outbreak of 1999–2000 caused infection in 413 flocks, including 25 backyard flocks, and resulted in the destruction of around 14 million birds. Control was complicated by the occurrence of cases in areas with extremely dense poultry populations. Compensation to farmers amounted to US$63 million. Costs for the poultry and associated industry have been estimated at US$620 million. Four months after the last outbreak ended, the virus returned in a low-pathogenic form, rapidly causing a further 52 outbreaks. – Although the last outbreak of highly pathogenic avian influenza in Mexico occurred in 1995, the causative agent – the H5N2 strain – has never been entirely eliminated from the country, in its present low-pathogenicity form, despite years of intense efforts, including the administration of more than 2 billion doses of vaccines of varying efficacy. Similarly, the vaccination policy pursued in Pakistan does not appear to have resulted in eradication of the causative agent.   Avoidance of contact between poultry and wild birds, especially ducks and other waterfowl, can help prevent the introduction of a low-pathogenicity virus into domestic flocks. Although no evidence to date has conclusively linked the current outbreaks with wild migratory birds in Asia: – Several of these outbreaks have been linked to contact between free-ranging flocks and wild birds, including the shared use of water sources. Faecal contamination of water supplies is considered a very efficient way for waterfowl to transmit the virus. Virus (low-pathogenicity) has been readily recovered from lakes and ponds where migratory birds congregate. – An especially risky practice is the raising of small numbers of domestic ducks on a pond in proximity to domestic chicken and turkey flocks. Domestic ducks attract wild ducks, and provide a significant link in the chain of transmission from wild birds to domestic flocks.   Aggressive control measures, including culling of infected and exposed poultry, are recommended for avian influenza virus subtypes H5 and H7 even when the virus initially shows low pathogenicity. (H5 and H7 are the only subtypes implicated in outbreaks of highly pathogenic disease.) – Several of the largest outbreaks (Pennsylvania, Mexico, Italy) initially began with mild illness in poultry. When the virus was allowed to continue circulating in poultry, it eventually mutated (within 6 to 9 months) into a highly pathogenic form with a mortality ratio approaching 100%. Moreover, the initial presence of low-pathogenicity virus in these outbreaks complicated diagnosis of the highly pathogenic form.  "

"2004","http://www.who.int/csr/don/2004_02_20/en/index.html"," Avian influenza A(H5N1) - update 28: Reports of infection in domestic cats (Thailand), Situation (human) in Thailand, Situation (poultry) in Japan and China   20 February 2004 Reports of infection in domestic cats (Thailand)   WHO is aware of reports of H5N1 infection in a single household of domestic cats in Thailand. Investigations are under way and no firm conclusions can be made at present. However, concern is great and several specific questions are being raised about risks to humans in close contact with infected cats and the need for surveillance of disease in cat populations.   H5N1 infection in two out of three dead domestic cats was announced today by the Faculty of Veterinary Sciences at Thailand’s Kasetsart University. The animals are part of a single household of 15 cats. Of these, 14 have died. Contact of one cat with dead chickens was observed by the owner.   Thailand’s Ministry of Public Health is investigating the incident in cats and is monitoring the health of human contacts. FAO is also contributing expertise.   While conclusions are premature pending the results of these investigations, confirmation of H5N1 infection in cats is not considered likely to enhance the present risks to human health. Nor is it considered likely to influence the future evolution of the outbreak in humans in any significant way.   Several studies have shown that a small number of mammalian species, including pigs, seals, whales, mink, and ferrets, are susceptible to natural infection with influenza viruses that are purely avian in their genetic make-up. Of these species, only the pig has significance for human health. Pigs can be co-infected with both avian and human influenza viruses and can thus serve as the “mixing vessel” for the mingling of genetic material, possibly resulting in the emergence of a new influenza virus subtype. Most experts agree that pigs played a role in the emergence of pandemic viruses in 1957 and 1968.   Up to now, domestic cats have not been considered susceptible to disease caused by natural infection with influenza viruses. Some older studies, from 1970,  1972, and 1981, reported experimental infection of domestic cats under laboratory conditions. Although infection occurred (virus was recovered from the respiratory tract), all of the cats remained healthy. None developed typical symptoms of influenza, including fever, nasal discharge, coughing or sneezing. These findings are important in that they strongly suggest that, should additional cats become infected with H5N1, they would not shed large quantities of the virus.   In contrast, H5N1 virus replicates in the intestines as well as the respiratory tract of birds. In the present outbreak, very large quantities of virus are being excreted in the faeces of infected birds, resulting in widespread contamination of the environment. This wide presence of the H5N1 virus in the environment creates one of the most important risks for human exposure and subsequent infection. Should domestic cats prove to be easily infected with H5N1, which is considered unlikely, their infection is not expected to contribute in a significant way to the presence of H5N1 virus in the environment.   Avian influenza viruses, including the specific strain implicated in the present outbreak, lack the receptors needed to infect mammals efficiently. However, the infection of humans observed in this and two previous H5N1 outbreaks demonstrates that transmission from birds to mammals can occur despite this lack of receptors. The very small number of human cases – despite abundant and widespread opportunities for exposure and subsequent infection – strongly suggests that transmission of H5N1 from birds to mammals, including cats as well as humans, is a rare event.   The reported infection of domestic cats with H5N1 is an unusual event in what is an historically unprecedented situation. Results from the investigation undertaken by Thai authorities will shed critical light on this unusual event.   Influenza viruses are highly unstable and their behaviour cannot be predicted. Vigilance for suspected cases in various mammalian species is presently high and should be continued. Reporting by veterinarians of suspected or confirmed cases to national authorities, as happened in the present situation, is a key component of this continuing vigilance.   WHO is collaborating closely with FAO and OIE as part of international efforts to understand the continuing evolution of the outbreaks in humans and animals, which are closely inter-related.   Situation (human) in Thailand   Since 23 January 2004, the Ministry of Public Health in Thailand has reported 9 laboratory-confirmed cases of human infection with H5N1 avian influenza. Of these, seven have died. The situation is reviewed daily by a joint team of ministry officials and WHO staff.   Preliminary epidemiological and clinical data on the first five cases were published last week by WHO. The subsequent four cases include two who have fully recovered (a 2-year old boy and a 27-year-old woman), a thirteen-year-old boy, and a four-year-old boy, who died on 3 February. All cases have been announced in previous updates.   Thai authorities are currently investigating a further 147 reports of patients admitted to hospital with suspicious symptoms. Of these, 21 are being considered as suspect cases of H5N1 infection. All have a clinical diagnosis of pneumonia. Eight have died, 8 have fully recovered, and 5 remain hospitalized.   The investigation of cases is following three lines: laboratory testing, epidemiological tracing of likely sources of infection, and examination of clinical features of disease.   Final results of laboratory testing are pending for the additional 126 patients under investigation. The results of virus isolation studies are pending. These studies, which can take up to 14 days, are used to verify and supplement the initial PCR findings. Recent enhancement of laboratory facilities at Thailand’s National Institutes of Health, including the addition of equipment for reverse transcriptase PCR testing, has expedited the processing of clinical samples, thus reducing the time from notification to obtaining the initial laboratory diagnosis. In this group of 126 patients, 19 are still being investigated to obtain more details about either potential exposure to affected poultry or the clinical features of disease.   The surveillance system in Thailand is on high alert. To date, 510 reports have been brought to the attention of health authorities. Of these, 354 have been excluded from consideration following thorough laboratory, epidemiological, and clinical investigation.   The most recently announced confirmed case was a four-year-old boy from the northeastern province of Khon Kaen. His family raised chickens, and many died shortly before the onset of his symptoms.   One of the most recently reported suspect cases is a two-year-old girl from a southern province. The family’s poultry died 7 days prior to the onset of her symptoms. The case is not yet laboratory confirmed. As H5N1 infection in poultry has not been reported in this province to date, the Ministry of Agriculture has been informed and is currently investigating animal illness in the area.   To date, no evidence suggests that human-to-human transmission has occurred in Thailand.   The number of reports brought to the attention of Thai authorities has declined and the numbers this week are low. The Ministry of Agriculture is currently responding to the detection, earlier this week, of the reappearance of infection in poultry in provinces where extensive culling was previously carried out. Rapid culling in the newly affected areas is now under way to prevent further spread, and thus reduce opportunities for the disease to become endemic.   Thailand’s Ministry of Public Health, with the full support of WHO, is stressing the need for continued vigilance and intensive surveillance.   Situation (poultry) in Japan   Japanese authorities have confirmed that the country’s second outbreak of avian influenza, detected in Oita Prefecture, is caused by the H5N1 strain.

The case, which was fatal, was a four-year-old boy from Khon Kaen Province. He died on 3 February.   To date, Thailand has reported nine cases of human H5N1 infection. Of these, seven were fatal.   Situation (human) in Viet Nam   The Ministry of Health in Viet Nam has today confirmed an additional case of H5N1 infection. Further details about the case, which was fatal, are pending.   To date, Viet Nam has reported 22 cases of human H5N1 infection. Of these, 15 were fatal.   Situation (poultry) in Asia   Highly pathogenic avian influenza, caused by the H5N1 strain, is currently infecting poultry in 8 Asian countries. Full control has not yet been achieved in any of these countries, despite intensive efforts in many.   Past experience with outbreaks of highly pathogenic avian influenza, previously considered rare, has demonstrated the difficulty of fully eliminating the virus in bird populations. Control has often taken several years, even under favourable circumstances (small geographical area, concentration in commercial production facilities).   In past outbreaks, investigations have shown that infection can be introduced into domestic flocks by wild aquatic birds, including migratory birds capable of flying long distances. The virus multiplies in the intestines of these birds, which can carry the virus without developing signs of infection, and very large quantities of virus are shed in faeces.   Once introduced into domestic flocks, the virus, which is highly contagious, can be mechanically carried from farm to farm via contaminated items, such as vehicles, clothing, and equipment.   Water sources contaminated by droppings from wild birds and shared by domestic poultry are just one example of how chains of transmission can be sustained once the virus becomes widespread in the environment. In the present outbreaks, the tendency to hide or smuggle especially valuable birds, such as fighting cocks, can also help maintain the virus in the environment or contribute to its further geographical spread.   The present situation in Asia is historically unprecedented and extremely challenging. Many affected countries are reporting highly pathogenic H5N1 infection in birds for the first time in their histories. In some of these countries, around 80% of the poultry are produced in small backyard farms scattered throughout rural areas, further complicating control.   Complete elimination of the virus is becoming increasingly challenging. As explained below , the consequences for human health could be considerable.   China - Outbreaks of H5N1 infection in poultry, first reported on 27 January, have continued to spread. To date, authorities have reported 52 outbreaks at poultry farms, of which 43 have been confirmed as caused by H5N1. Altogether, 16 of the country’s 31 provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities have been affected. Xizang (Tibet) Autonomous Region and Jilin Province are the most recently affected areas.   As formally reported to OIE on 11 February, around 2.3 million poultry have been culled.   Japan - Authorities have confirmed a small outbreak in Oita Prefecture as caused by the H5 subtype. Further testing is under way to confirm the possible involvement of the H5N1 strain.   Republic of Korea - On 7 February, authorities reported new outbreaks at 8 duck farms, 7 chicken farms, and one mixed farm with chickens and ducks. Around 350,000 birds died or were destroyed in the most recent outbreaks.   Thailand - Authorities in Thailand have today reported 14 new outbreaks in various provinces, including one province where the disease had not been reported previously. More than 27 million birds have either died or been destroyed. Infections in chickens, ducks, geese, turkeys, ostriches, quail, and peacocks have been reported.   Viet Nam - Outbreaks have been detected in 57 of the country’s 64 provinces. More than 27 million birds have either died or been destroyed.   Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos - Information on the status of poultry outbreaks in these countries is still being gathered.   Implications for human health   The H5N1 strain has demonstrated its capacity to directly infect humans on three occasions in the recent past. The H5N1 strain is capable of infecting a broad range of hosts, which may help explain recent media reports of infections and deaths in mammalian and avian species not normally considered susceptible to infection and severe disease.   In humans, the disease caused by H5N1 infection differs from that usually caused by influenza viruses, where respiratory symptoms are dominant. H5N1 has a documented ability to replicate in a wide range of cell types, resulting in severe disseminated disease affecting multiple organs and causing high mortality. These clinical features were observed during the first recorded human outbreak of H5N1 infection in Hong Kong in 1997. These features are being seen again in the earliest clinical reports from Viet Nam and Thailand.   For all these reasons, the present situation in Asia needs to be watched very carefully. Countries need to maintain a high level of vigilance, and must not relax their surveillance and detection efforts. Intense efforts to control the disease in poultry must continue in some countries and be initiated in others. Preparedness measures for dealing with an incipient pandemic situation, launched by WHO last month, are continuing and much progress is being made.  "

The case is a 13-year-old boy from Chaiyaphum Province. Preliminary investigation has linked the case to contact with diseased chickens near his home.   Situation (human) in Viet Nam   The Ministry of Health in Viet Nam has today confirmed an additional case of H5N1. The case, which was fatal, was in a 19-year-old man, who had been hospitalized in Ho Chi Minh City.   To date, Viet Nam has reported 19 confirmed cases, of which 14 have been fatal.   First data on patients from Viet Nam   WHO is today publishing the first clinical and epidemiological data on 10 human H5N1 cases in the Viet Nam outbreak. The data have been compiled by Vietnamese clinicians, epidemiologists, and laboratory scientists involved in the first-hand treatment and investigation of cases. WHO is grateful to these authors for allowing immediate publication of their findings.   - Preliminary clinical and epidemiological description of influenza A (H5N1) in Viet Nam   Clinical information on five laboratory-confirmed cases in Thailand will be published by WHO tomorrow morning in the Weekly Epidemiological Record.   Publication of clinical data for 15 cases in the present outbreak sheds important light on distinctive features of illness caused by H5N1 infection that should assist in worldwide surveillance and early detection of cases. A case definition for global reporting, supported by information on appropriate laboratory tests for confirmation of diagnosis, was published by WHO yesterday.   Clinical data from Hong Kong 1997   Up to now, knowledge about H5N1 disease in humans was limited to clinical studies of the 18 cases in Hong Kong in 1997. In that outbreak, patients, who ranged in age from 1 to 60 years, had gastrointestinal symptoms, hepatitis, renal failure, and pancytopenia. These findings indicate that H5N1 infection affects more body organs and systems than normal influenza, where respiratory symptoms are dominant. Also, unlike normal influenza, death in the six fatal cases occurred as a result of the primary viral infection rather than a secondary infection caused by bacteria.   One month into the outbreak   Laboratory results confirming the first 3 human cases of H5N1 infection were announced on 12 January. Today, one month into the outbreak, WHO is issuing a chronology of key events in both the human and poultry outbreaks, which are intricately interrelated.   WHO is also stressing the need to maintain vigilance for suspected cases and to report suspected disease, in humans and animals, promptly and transparently. The disease in poultry is still spreading in several areas. In others, progress in controlling the avian outbreak does not mean that the risk to human health has been eliminated.   Several countries with outbreaks in poultry have weak health infrastructures, with weak capacity for the detection of cases, particularly in rural areas where the majority of domestic birds are raised. Capacity to diagnose a difficult disease such as H5N1 is also weak. Moreover, as the clinical material published today and tomorrow indicates, the full clinical spectrum of H5N1 illness is unknown. Milder cases of illness could be occurring, yet fail to reach the attention of health care staff.   As today’s report from Viet Nam states, “These (10) cases were identified by alert clinicians in tertiary care hospitals and cannot be taken to be representative of the full range of illness that H5N1 may cause.”   For all these reasons, the current small number of laboratory-confirmed cases cannot be taken as an accurate indication of the magnitude of the present or potential threat to human health.   Susceptibility of H5N1 viruses to antiviral drugs   Data received from the WHO Global Influenza Surveillance Network indicate that recent H5N1 viruses are susceptible to oseltamivir, one of the two licensed neuraminidase inhibitors. All strains tested (4 isolates from humans and 33 isolates from birds) demonstrated in vitro susceptibility to this drug.   Oseltamivir belongs to one of two classes of drugs that can be used to prevent or treat influenza in humans. Studies previously conducted by laboratories in the influenza network have shown that most recent H5N1 strains are resistant to the second class of drugs, the M2 inhibitors (amantadine and rimantadine).

The guidelines include the definition of a laboratory-confirmed case of human H5N1 infection, and describe procedures for reporting cases to WHO. The guidelines also provide recommended procedures to monitor changes in transmission patterns and to detect potential human-to-human transmission.   The guidelines are intended to improve global vigilance for the further spread of H5N1 infections in humans and animals, and for the first signs that human-to-human transmission may be occurring. Use of standardized procedures and reporting forms will improve the quality of information needed by WHO to advise on the most appropriate control measures.   Situation (poultry) China   Chinese authorities have announced a suspected outbreak of H5N1 avian influenza at a chicken farm in Tianjin. Spread to additional farms within several provinces has also been reported.   Altogether, outbreaks of H5N1 in poultry are suspected or confirmed at 39 farms in 14 of the country’s provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities.   To date, no human cases have been reported in China.   Investigation of possible human-to-human transmission: data on second sister in family cluster in Viet Nam   WHO has today received the results from a study of virus isolated from a 23-year-old woman (see Updates 19 and 20) who is part of a family cluster in Viet Nam under investigation as the first possible instance of human-to-human transmission. Virus genetic material from this woman, as for the other case in this cluster, is of avian origin and contains no human influenza genes.  "

All three cases were hospitalized in Ho Chi Minh City.   The newly confirmed cases are a 6-year-old child, who died on 3 February, a 24-year-old man, who died on 3 February, and a 23-year-old man, who remains hospitalized.   Altogether, Viet Nam has reported 18 laboratory confirmed cases, 13 of which were fatal.   Overview of the global situation: public health concerns   – The outbreaks of H5N1 avian influenza in poultry, currently reported in eight Asian countries, are historically unprecedented in their scale, geographical spread, and economic consequences for the agricultural sector.   – The risk is great that the H5N1 strain has become endemic in poultry populations of this geographical area.   – Infection in birds could spread to distant regions.   – To date, human cases have been reported in only two countries, Viet Nam and Thailand, with very widespread outbreaks in poultry.   – It can be anticipated that human cases will also be detected in other countries where outbreaks in poultry are spreading.   – Evidence to date suggests that the H5N1 strain is not easily transmitted from poultry to humans.   – Influenza viruses are genetically unstable and their behaviour cannot be predicted. The present situation could change very quickly.   – When a disease which affects an economically important sector of agriculture also poses a risk to human health, the risk to humans – however unpredictable – must not be minimized in the interest of maintaining consumer confidence.   – Measures aimed at eliminating the disease in poultry also reduce opportunities for human exposures and infections. These measures must be carried out urgently, giving highest priority to the protection of human health.   Correction On 6 February, WHO reported the results from genetic sequencing of H5N1 viruses taken from two sisters in a family cluster in Viet Nam. The sequencing announced Friday by WHO showed that the two viruses were both entirely of avian origin with no human genes, indicating the viruses had not become adapted to be easily transmitted from one human to another.   Today, WHO has learned that the virus from only one sister has been sequenced, not both sisters. The second virus sequenced and reported was from another case in Viet Nam.   The virus from the second sister is being sequenced this week.  "

Both cases were fatal.   The two cases were in young women, aged 16 and 17 years, from the southern part of the country. Both were treated at hospitals in Ho Chi Minh City. The 16-year-old woman died on 3 February. The 17-year-old woman died on 27 January.   These cases bring the number of laboratory confirmed H5N1 infections in Viet Nam to 15. Of these, 11 have died, two remain hospitalized, and two have recovered.   Situation (human) in Thailand   The Ministry of Public Health in Thailand has confirmed the country’s fifth human case of H5N1 infection. The case, a six-year-old boy from Kanchanaburi Province, developed illness on 24 January and died on 2 February.   All five laboratory-confirmed cases in Thailand have been fatal.   FAO/OIE/WHO Technical Consultation on the Control of Avian Influenza (Rome, 3–4 February 2004)   Several conclusions and recommendations made during this consultation strengthen WHO recommendations for protecting humans from the consequences of widespread outbreaks of highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza in poultry in several Asian countries.   Experts at the consultation recognized the need for immediate application of measures to prevent human infection in groups, notably poultry workers and cullers, at high risk of exposure to the H5N1 avian influenza virus. Personal protective equipment should be available for persons in these groups, who also need training in the proper use of this equipment. WHO has issued guidelines for the protection of cullers.   The experts further recognized the need to reduce opportunities for the simultaneous infection of humans with H5N1 and human strains of influenza virus. Such dual infections give the avian and human viruses opportunities to exchange genes, possibly resulting in the emergence of a new influenza virus subtype. The consultation recommended that poultry workers, who can experience intensive exposures, be given the existing seasonal influenza vaccine. (The vaccine protects against infection with currently circulating human influenza viruses, but does not protect against H5N1 infection). WHO has issued guidelines for the targeted administration of seasonal vaccines.   WHO priorities for responding to the current situation include rapid control of the animal reservoir of H5N1, as doing so reduces the risk of both more cases and deaths in humans and more opportunities for a new subtype of the influenza virus to emerge. Recommendations from the consultation also support this priority.   The consultation concluded that culling, or “stamping out”, of infected flocks remains the preferred option for controlling H5N1 outbreaks in poultry. However, the present outbreaks in poultry are historically unprecedented in their scale, geographical spread, and devastating economic consequences for both the poultry industry and rural farmers.   While culling remains the preferred option for infected flocks, targeted vaccination of healthy poultry can be used as a complementary tool for achieving the rapid reduction of the risk posed by the H5N1 virus in its avian host – an objective which supports both elimination of the disease in poultry and prevention of further human cases and deaths.   Vaccination alone will not be sufficient to bring the present outbreaks in poultry under control.   Experts at the consultation stressed that, where vaccination is being considered as a complementary control tool, it must be used in conjunction with a comprehensive strategy that includes culling of all diseased or exposed poultry, strict biosecurity, quarantine, and other measures aimed at preventing further spread of the disease.

The case, a 58-year-old woman, fell ill on 19 January and died on 27 January.   This latest case brings the total of human cases in Thailand to 4, of whom 3 have died.   To date, human cases of H5N1 have been reported only in Thailand and Viet Nam. Both countries have widespread outbreaks of the disease in poultry. The new case in Thailand brings the total number of cases in these two countries to 14, of whom 11 have died.   China announces spread of suspected H5N1 infection in poultry to additional areas   WHO has been informed by Chinese authorities that outbreaks in poultry of highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza are suspected in additional parts of the country.   The new suspected poultry outbreaks have been detected at farms in the eastern province of Zhejiang (geese), in the southwestern province of Yunnan (chickens), in the central province of Henan (chickens), and in Xinjiang Uygar Autonomous Region (chickens) in northwestern China.   In addition, further suspected outbreaks have been reported in Hubei (chickens and ducks) and Guangdong (geese) provinces. Both provinces had previously reported outbreaks.   Samples taken from diseased birds at all these sites are now being tested in China for the presence of the H5N1 strain.   Altogether, confirmed or suspected outbreaks of highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza have been reported on poultry farms in 10 of China’s 31 provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities.   The additional areas with outbreaks in poultry, announced last week, are Guangxi, Hunan, Hubei, Shanghai, Guangdong, and Anhui provinces. Of these, highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza has been confirmed in Guangxi, Hunan, and Hubei.   No cases of human H5N1 infection have been reported in China to date.   Investigation of possible human-to-human transmission   WHO has investigated a cluster of respiratory illness in members of a family from Thai Binh province, Viet Nam. The cluster involves a 31-year-old man, his two sisters, aged 23 and 30 years, and his 28-year-old wife. Both the man and his two sisters have died. The wife has fully recovered. Laboratory tests received over the weekend have confirmed H5N1 infection in the sisters. Neither the man nor his wife was tested.   The family members gathered in late December to prepare for the man’s wedding on 3 January. Both the man and one sister are reported to have handled ducks while preparing a meal on 4 January. However, the investigation failed to reveal any direct contact with poultry for the man’s other sister and his wife.   In the absence of evidence of direct exposure to poultry in these two cases, WHO epidemiologists are considering various alternative explanations. Both sisters are known to have provided health care for their brother, prior to his hospitalization, and would thus have had opportunities for close exposure. Direct human-to-human transmission following this close exposure is thus one possible explanation.   However, contact with an infected bird, or some other environmental source of the virus, is another possible route of infection that has not been ruled out. Outbreaks of H5N1 in poultry are widespread in Viet Nam. Large amounts of the virus are excreted in bird droppings, and can survive for some time in the environment.   Limited human-to-human transmission of a highly pathogenic avian influenza virus is not entirely unexpected, as this has been documented to have occurred on two occasions in the recent past (in Hong Kong in 1997 and in the Netherlands in 2003).   Local authorities report that no other family members or wedding guests developed an illness. No illness has been detected in members of the community where the wedding was held, or in health staff involved in care of these cases.   WHO stresses the need to continue to investigate each human case of H5N1 in order to identify the source of infection.  "

In Hong Kong in 1997, extensive studies, using both molecular and epidemiological data, eventually linked all 18 cases of human H5N1 infection to contact with live infected poultry.   In addition to these 18 cases, WHO notes that laboratory evidence indicated very limited human-to-human transmission during the H5N1 outbreak in Hong Kong, and during a 2003 outbreak of highly pathogenic H7N7 avian influenza in the Netherlands. However, no cases of severe disease in humans occurred as a result of this very limited secondary transmission.   In the current family cluster of cases in Viet Nam, WHO considers that limited human-to-human transmission, from the brother to his sisters, is one possible explanation. The investigation failed to reveal a specific event, such as contact with infected poultry or an environmental source, that might explain the source of infection in these cases. However, as H5N1 infection in poultry is widespread in Viet Nam, direct transmission from poultry to humans cannot be entirely ruled out on the basis of available evidence.   At present, no evidence indicates that efficient human-to-human transmission is occurring in Viet Nam or elsewhere. WHO and health authorities in Viet Nam and globally are continuing to assess the outbreak in terms of its epidemiological evolution. Human cases are being investigated to identify the source of infection, and evidence to date is reassuring.   WHO teams are supporting national investigations in Viet Nam and Thailand, and will arrive soon in other countries that have requested such support.  "

The new case is a 40-year old director of a hospital and practicing physician from Guangzhou, Guangdong Province who developed symptoms of SARS on 7 January 2004. He was admitted to a hospital in Guangdong with pneumonia on 16 January and placed in respiratory isolation on the suspicion of SARS. He has made a full recovery and was discharged home on 30 January.   In accordance with WHO recommendations for SARS-CoV testing in the inter-epidemic period, the results of SARS-CoV testing performed at the national reference laboratory in Beijing were verified by a WHO SARS International Reference and Verification Network laboratory in Hong Kong.   At present, the source of infection in this most recent SARS case is unknown. The Ministry of Health is conducting an epidemiological investigation into possible sources of transmission and has carried out contact tracing and other public health measures. To date, none of the contacts so far identified has developed symptoms of  SARS. The Ministry is also collaborating with WHO China Country Office to further investigate this and the other recent SARS cases in Guangdong province.

The outbreaks, which are laboratory confirmed, have been detected in Hunan and Hubei provinces.   A confirmed outbreak of highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza at a duck farm in Guangxi province was announced on 27 January.   As announced today, outbreaks of disease in poultry have also been detected at farms in Anhui, Shanghai, and Guangdong provinces. According to the authorities, highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza is the suspected cause. Samples from birds in these outbreaks are being tested, in China, to confirm the causative agent.   Local authorities in the affected provinces have undertaken immediate culling operations and quarantining of farms. Compulsory vaccination of poultry is being introduced.   At present, no human cases of H5N1 infection have been detected in China.   Development of an H5N1 vaccine for humans: need for samples and viruses   With the confirmed spread of H5N1 infection in poultry in China, WHO is again stressing the need for access to samples and viruses from all countries currently experiencing H5N1 outbreaks. Such materials are needed to support laboratory studies being conducted by the WHO Global Influenza Surveillance Network.   Up to now, laboratories in the WHO network have analyzed viruses from the current outbreaks made available by authorities in Cambodia, Japan, the Republic of Korea, and Viet Nam. Viruses from the outbreaks in Indonesia, Laos, and Thailand are expected to be available for analysis soon.   Network laboratories are now working to develop a prototype virus that can be recommended by WHO for use by companies in the production of a human vaccine effective against H5N1 influenza strains. Both human and avian viruses are needed. Information from these viruses will help WHO and its partners ensure that a fully tested and licensed vaccine for humans is available as soon as possible.   Protection of workers involved in culling operations   As more countries announce plans for the mass slaughter of poultry, WHO continues to stress the need for personal protection of these workers. Targeted administration of seasonal influenza vaccine to high-risk groups, such as cullers and poultry workers, is being recommended as one of several measures that reduce opportunities for the emergence of a new influenza virus subtype with pandemic potential. Guidelines for the use of seasonal influenza vaccine in humans at risk of H5N1 infection have been issued today.  "

Such action is the major line of defence for preventing further human cases of H5N1 infection and possibly averting the emergence of a new influenza virus with pandemic potential.   WHO continues to stress the need for personal protection of these workers, who are at high risk of exposure to a virus that has demonstrated its capacity to cause severe disease and deaths in humans. Recommendations about safety measures that should be in place before the mass destruction of poultry begins have been issued. Adherence to these recommendations will reduce the likelihood that measures aimed at preventing the further spread of H5N1 infection in poultry might lead to increased transmission of the virus to humans.   Those organizing culling operations in affected countries need to ensure that WHO recommendations are followed as strictly as possible. The recommendations spell out the appropriate personal protective equipment, which includes goggles and preferably N95 respirator masks, as well as specific types of protective clothing that can be either disinfected or discarded after use. Frequent handwashing is strongly recommended.   WHO also recommends that effective antiviral drugs be readily available for the treatment of suspected H5N1 respiratory infections in cullers and farm workers.   N95 masks and prophylactic treatment with antiviral drugs were used to protect thousands of poultry workers and cullers during an outbreak of highly pathogenic H7N7 avian influenza in the Netherlands in 2003. During that outbreak, nearly 30 million poultry were destroyed. Although avian influenza virus caused mild illness in 89 poultry workers and members of their families, the single death in that outbreak occurred in a veterinarian who was not adequately protected.   Investigation of the origins of the current outbreaks in poultry   Countries currently experiencing outbreaks of highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza in poultry have provided numerous samples and viruses to laboratories in the WHO Global Influenza Surveillance Network. WHO is grateful for the high level of international collaboration of all affected countries and influenza experts around the world.   Laboratory characterization of several viruses from humans and different species of birds has helped to compare, retrospectively, H5N1 viruses taken from infected birds and humans in January 2004 with viruses obtained from birds several months ago. Results indicate that the virus now causing severe disease in poultry and some humans has been circulating in parts of Asia for longer than initially presumed.   Presently available evidence from these studies is not sufficient to support any speculations about the geographical origins of the current outbreaks of highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza.   Up to now, laboratories in the WHO network have analyzed viruses from the current outbreaks made available by authorities in Cambodia, Japan, South Korea, and Viet Nam. Viruses from the outbreaks in Indonesia, Laos, and Thailand are expected to be available for analysis soon.  "

The document also outlines specific measures that should be taken on an urgent basis to prevent further human cases and reduce opportunities for a new pandemic virus to emerge.

"2004","http://www.who.int/csr/don/2004_01_27/en/index.html"," Update 4: Review of probable and laboratory-confirmed SARS cases in southern China   27 January 2004   Health authorities in China announced a second laboratory-confirmed case of SARS in the southern province of Guangdong on 17 January 2004. The patient, a 20-year-old female waitress, has fully recovered and has been discharged from hospital. None of her known contacts have shown any signs or symptoms suggestive of SARS and the observation period has now ended. Two laboratories in the WHO SARS Reference and Verification Laboratory Network verified the test results. WHO now considers this individual to be a confirmed case of SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) infection.   A third person – a 35-year old business man – fulfils the WHO laboratory case definition for probable SARS described in the document ‘WHO SARS Reference and Verification Laboratory Network: Policies and Procedures in the Inter-Epidemic Period’ . He has tested positive for SARS-CoV infection at a national reference laboratory in China and on preliminary serological tests performed by WHO SARS International Reference and Verification Network laboratories in Hong Kong. He was discharged from hospital on 21 January.   As with the 32-year old television journalist with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV infection, none of the known contacts of the 20-year old woman and the 35-year old man have developed a SARS-like illness. All of the health care workers attending these patients have remained well.   The source of infection in these individuals has not been determined although a possible animal source is being investigated. These cases highlight the need for continued vigilance and epidemiological enquiry as to the source of infection. Collecting specimens for virus isolation and molecular studies remains crucially important to further elucidate the epidemiology of SARS-CoV infection in humans, the risk of re-introduction to humans from animal or environmental sources and changes in the genetic makeup of the virus that may lead to increased virulence or attenuation to milder forms. The correct specimens to be collected for laboratory confirmation of SARS-CoV infection have been described in ‘WHO SARS Reference and Verification Laboratory Network: Policies and Procedures in the Inter-Epidemic Period’.   Some degree of caution needs to be exercised in the interpretation of serological test results in non-epidemic periods. False positive test results for SARS-CoV can result from current or past infection with other human or animal coronaviruses. Laboratory investigations resulting in positive tests for SARS-CoV should therefore be interpreted in the context of the clinical and epidemiological findings before any large-scale public health action is initiated. For these reasons, WHO recommends independent verification of positive results reported by national reference laboratories in one or more WHO SARS Reference and Verification Network laboratories during the inter-epidemic period.   Surveillance for people with fever and respiratory illnesses has been intensified in Guangdong and other provinces of China since the SARS epidemic. It is therefore likely that people with respiratory illness will be investigated for SARS over the coming weeks. This is because symptoms of SARS resemble those of several other respiratory diseases, including many that are more frequently seen during the winter months. These recent cases show that the enhancements to the surveillance system in China are working.   A joint team of WHO and Chinese experts has been investigating possible sources of infection in these individuals. These investigations have not yet determined the source of infection in these cases. There is some circumstantial evidence that the waitress was infected from contact with Himalayan palm civets. Samples collected from cages that housed civets at the restaurant where the waitress worked have tested positive for traces of the SARS-CoV. However, evidence that civets transmit SARS-CoV to humans remains inconclusive.   As the period of observation for illness among contacts of the two confirmed and one probable case of SARS has ended with no additional cases, these events are not considered a global public health threat.

The patient, who remains alive, is a 6-year-old child from Sukhothai province.   Health officials in Thailand have also confirmed the death of a 6-year-old boy from Kanchanaburi province. The boy, whose infection with the H5N1 strain was announced on Friday, died Sunday night. He had been hospitalized in Bangkok with severe pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome.

The cases, both in Ho Chi Minh City, are two children, an 8-year-old girl and a 13-year-old boy. The boy died on 22 January. The girl is hospitalized in stable, but critical condition.   The two cases are the first to be confirmed in the south of the country. They bring the total number of confirmed H5N1 cases in Viet Nam to seven, including five in Hanoi. Of the seven cases in Viet Nam, six (five children and one 30-year old woman) have died since 30 December 2003.   A WHO team is in Viet Nam working closely with health authorities to assess the current situation, conduct epidemiological investigations, and identify the most appropriate control measures.   Overview of the current situation   Yesterday, health authorities in Thailand announced laboratory confirmed H5N1 infection in two boys. Additional patients with respiratory symptoms that might signal H5N1 infection are being tested, and results are expected next week.   At present, Viet Nam and Thailand are the only two countries in which human cases of H5N1 avian influenza are known to have occurred in the current outbreak. The first recorded outbreak of H5N1 infection in humans occurred in Hong Kong in 1997, when 18 persons developed serious disease and six died.   The present human cases in Viet Nam and Thailand coincide with an historically unprecedented spread of highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza in the poultry populations of Asian countries. Since mid-December 2003, outbreaks of H5N1 disease in poultry have been confirmed in the Republic of Korea, Viet Nam, Japan, Thailand, and Cambodia. Additional countries have detected deaths in poultry flocks, and the cause is currently under investigation.   In Viet Nam, H5N1 infection in poultry has now been detected in 23 of the country’s 64 provinces. Since 23 December 2003, about 2.9 million poultry stock have either died or been destroyed because of the disease.   WHO has identified the rapid culling of H5N1 infected or exposed poultry as the major line of defence for preventing further human cases and possibly averting the emergence of a new influenza virus capable of causing an influenza pandemic.   At present, WHO has no evidence that person-to-person transmission is occurring.   Laboratories in the WHO Global Influenza Surveillance Network are characterizing avian and human viruses obtained from the current outbreaks. Preliminary results indicate that these viruses are significantly different from other H5N1 strains isolated in Asia in the recent past, thus necessitating the development of a new prototype strain for use in vaccine manufacturing.   Viruses are needed from all areas currently experiencing outbreaks in either infected birds or humans. Information from these viruses will then be used by WHO network laboratories to develop H5N1 prototype strains for vaccine manufacturers. Information about viruses from all outbreak sites is needed to ensure that the vaccine composition recommended by WHO will protect humans against all currently circulating H5N1 strains.   Implications for food safety   Since 1997, when the H5N1 avian influenza virus strain is first known to have caused infections in humans, fewer than 30 laboratory-confirmed cases have been documented worldwide. The 1997 outbreak in Hong Kong has been extensively studied. However, data about this disease in humans and its modes of transmission are limited by the small number of cases.   Investigations of the Hong Kong outbreak determined that close contact with live infected poultry was the source of human infection in all 18 cases. For this reason, the practice of marketing live poultry directly to consumers should be discouraged in areas currently experiencing outbreaks of highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza among poultry.   While trade restrictions have been put in place by some countries to protect animal health, on the basis of presently available data, WHO does not conclude that any processed poultry products (whole refrigerated or frozen carcasses and products derived from them) and eggs in or arriving from areas currently experiencing outbreaks of avian influenza H5N1 in poultry flocks pose a risk to public health.   It is well known that influenza viruses are killed by adequate heat. WHO continuously emphasizes, and in this particular situation reiterates, the importance of good hygiene practices during handling of poultry products, including hand washing, prevention of cross-contamination and thorough cooking (70°C).

"2004","http://www.who.int/csr/don/2004_01_22/en/index.html"," Avian influenza H5N1 infection in humans: urgent need to eliminate the animal reservoir - update 5   22 January 2004   Epidemics of highly pathogenic avian influenza, caused by various H5N1 strains, have been reported in parts of Asia since mid-December 2003. Millions of domestic poultry have either died or been destroyed as a result. Thousands of workers have been involved in the culling operations.   The current situation is of serious concern for human health as well as for agriculture and the poultry industry. Rapid elimination of the H5N1 virus in bird populations should be given high priority as a matter of international public health importance.   WHO is collaborating closely, at high levels, with FAO and the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) to ensure that appropriate measures in the agricultural sector are introduced as a matter of urgency, and in the interest of protecting public health at the international level. Joint investigations are currently under way in Viet Nam.   Of all the avian influenza viruses, which normally cause infection in birds and pigs only, the H5N1 strain may have a unique capacity to cause severe disease, with high mortality, in humans.   The simultaneous occurrence in several countries of large epidemics of highly pathogenic H5N1 influenza in domestic poultry is historically unprecedented. The present situation may grow worse. In bird populations, the disease is highly contagious and rapidly fatal, and spreads easily from farm to farm. Wild migratory waterfowl can spread infection to domestic flocks. The potential for further spread of ongoing poultry epidemics, both within affected countries and to other countries, is therefore great.   For all these reasons, the H5N1 strain may be more widely established in bird populations and in the environment in this part of the world than presently appreciated. Studies have shown that infected birds can shed large amounts of the virus in their faeces. The virus can survive for long periods in the tissues and faeces of diseased birds and in water, especially when temperatures are low. In water, the virus can survive for up to four days at 22oC and more than 30 days at 0oC. The virus survives in frozen material indefinitely.   The large epidemics of highly pathogenic avian influenza currently seen in poultry, and possible widespread presence of the virus in the environment, increase opportunities for human exposure and infection. They also increase opportunities for human and avian influenza viruses to exchange genes This can occur when humans are simultaneously infected by human and avian influenza viruses. The frequency of such co-infections increases the likelihood that a completely new influenza virus subtype might emerge, carrying sufficient human genes to allow efficient and sustainable person-to-person transmission.   Research has shown that the risk of direct transmission of H5N1 infection from birds to humans is greatest in persons having close contact with live infected poultry. Contact with poultry kept in live markets is considered the source of infection for 17 of the 18 human cases of H5N1 infection that occurred in Hong Kong in 1997. The additional case – the first in the outbreak – has been linked to contact with poultry at farms experiencing epidemics of highly pathogenic avian H5N1 influenza. Six of the 18 cases were fatal.   Occupational exposure can occur among poultry workers, and among workers involved in culling operations.   Rapid elimination of the H5N1 virus in animal populations is an essential measure to prevent the emergence of a new influenza virus subtype with pandemic potential. This measure not only helps prevent further spread in bird populations, but also reduces opportunities for human infection. However, in the present situation, the problem of controlling all human exposures is compounded by the large number of “back yard” farms where chickens are kept in rural areas.   While rapid culling of infected or exposed flocks is strongly recommended, prevention of infection during culling operations must also be given high priority. Culling operations can place large numbers of workers at risk of brief but intensive exposure to the virus.   In 1997, Hong Kong authorities culled the entire poultry population, an estimated 1.5 million birds, within three days. This rapid and comprehensive action is thought by many experts to have averted an influenza pandemic. Culling operations were performed by trained government workers, most of whom wore protective masks, gloves, and gowns. Although subsequent investigation detected H5 antibodies, indicating exposure to the virus, in around 3% of persons involved in the culling of infected poultry, no case of severe respiratory disease was detected as a result of this exposure.   In the Netherlands in 2003, an outbreak of highly pathogenic H7N7 avian influenza in poultry caused infection, with mild illness, in 89 persons, and fatal illness in a veterinarian. An estimated 30 million poultry were culled within a week.   Further information about highly pathogenic avian influenza is available in a WHO fact sheet, at the FAO web site , and the OIE web site . Information on safety precautions during culling operations will be issued soon by the WHO Regional Office for the Western Pacific.   Laboratory characterization of the 2004 H5N1 viruses   Laboratories in the WHO Global Influenza Surveillance Network have today discussed results from the sequencing and antigenic characterization of H5N1 strains isolated from humans and poultry in Viet Nam. Initial results show significant differences between these viruses and strains obtained during outbreaks of H5N1 avian influenza in Hong Kong, in 1997 and 2003, indicating that the virus has mutated.   Work continues on the updating of WHO diagnostic kits for the rapid detection of H5N1 infection in humans, and on the development of a prototype virus for use in vaccine manufacturing. Viruses from birds in other currently affected countries are urgently needed in order to conduct additional laboratory investigations. Such investigations are part of the information needed by WHO to recommend and develop a vaccine strain that can protect humans against circulating H5N1 strains.  "

Most reported influenza infections this season have been attributed to influenza A(H3N2) viruses. The majority of A(H3N2) viruses antigenically characterized so far have been shown to be A/Fujian/411/2002-like; the others have been A/Panama/2007/99-like.   In Viet Nam there have been 5 laboratory-confirmed cases of infection with A(H5N1) virus . All have died. On Tuesday 6 January, WHO announced influenza pandemic preparedness Phase 0 Level 2   Several countries have reported outbreaks of highly pathogenic influenza A(H5N1) in poultry. This is of great concern as frequent transmission of avian influenza viruses to humans increases the possibility for genetic reassortment with circulating human influenza strains and the possibility of a new influenza pandemic caused by such reassortant viruses . A WHO team has been sent to Viet Nam to investigate the outbreaks and WHO Collaborating Centres for Reference and Research on Influenza and some national reference laboratories are conducting antigenic and genetic analysis of the H5N1 viruses isolated from human and birds during the recent outbreaks in Asia. Results will guide WHO in preparing prototype viruses for pandemic vaccine production and providing diagnostic test kits for H5N1 viruses to national influenza centres.   Reports from individual countries   Austria. An increase in influenza activity was observed in week 2 (4–10 January), although the acute respiratory illness (ARI) consultation rate was still below the epidemic threshold.   Belgium. Influenza A(H3N2) activity continued to decline in week 2, with a fall in both the number of viruses identified and the influenza-like illness (ILI) consultation rate. Regional influenza activity was reported for week 2.   Canada. In week 2, widespread influenza activity continued in Newfoundland, Quebec and Ontario. The overall ILI consultation rate was 40 cases per 1000 consultations, which was within the expected range for the time of year. Of the 490 influenza viruses antigenically characterized by the National Microbiology Laboratory to date, 456 (93%) were A/Fujian/411/2002-like, 25 (5%) were A/Panama/2007/99-like, one was an A/New Caledonia/20/99 (H1N1)-like virus, one was A(H1N2) and 7 (1.4%) were influenza B viruses (1 B/Hong Kong/330/2001-like and 6 B/Sichuan/379/99-like).   Croatia. Influenza A(H3N2) activity continued to increase significantly and was reported as widespread for week 2, with 10 influenza A(H3N2) and 11 A non-subtyped viruses identified.   Denmark. Influenza activity declined in week 2, with the ILI consultation rate dropping below the epidemic threshold.   France. Influenza activity continued to decline throughout France. Widespread influenza A(H3N2) activity was reported in one region for week 2.   Germany.

Influenza A(H3N2) activity increased significantly in week 2, with localized activity reported.   Norway. Influenza activity has been declining gradually since week 51, although significant activity still remained in large parts of the country in week 2. Of 919 influenza A virus detected so far this season, 237 were subtyped as A(H3) and 27 as A(H1). All A(H3) strains antigenically characterized were A/Fujian/411/2002-like and all A(H1) strains were A/New Caledonia/20/99-like. The neuraminidase of recent A(H1N2) viruses was N2.   Romania. Regional influenza activity was reported for week 2, with medium ARI morbidity.   Russia Federation. Widespread influenza activity persisted. In 21 of 34 cities, ILI morbidity exceeded the epidemic threshold by 16.6–127.8% in week 2.   Slovenia. Influenza activity increased significantly in week 2 and was reported as regional.   Sweden. The ILI consultation rate decreased in week 2, with 138 influenza viruses detected. Influenza activity was reported as regional.   Switzerland. In week 2, the ILI consultation rate and the number of influenza viruses detected declined for the first time since the beginning of the recent epidemic phase, although activity remained widespread. All strains antigenically characterized were closely related to influenza A/Fujian/411/2002-like virus.   Ukraine. In week 2, widespread influenza activity was reported in the north and east the country; an increase in activity was observed in the west.   United Kingdom. During week 2 the ILI consultation rate changed little in England, Scotland and Wales but increased slightly in Northern Ireland. The number of specimens decreased following the overall decline in influenza activity. No influenza virus was detected during week 2. Of the viruses antigenically characterized, 172 (97%) have been confirmed as A/Fujian/411/2002-like, 3 as A/Panama/2007/99-like and 2 as B/Hong Kong/330/2001-like.   United States. The overall ILI consultation rate, the number of states reporting widespread influenza activity and the percentage of specimens testing positive for influenza continued to decrease in week 2. However, pneumonia and influenza mortality (10.2%) continued to increase and exceeded the epidemic threshold (8.1%) for the time of year. Widespread influenza activity was reported in 20 states and in New York City, and regional activity was reported in 24 states during week 2. Of the specimens tested, 11.9% were positive for influenza, with 313 influenza A viruses and 6 B viruses identified. Since week 40, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta have antigenically characterized 2 influenza A(H1) viruses, 511 A(H3N2) viruses and 5 B viruses from the USA. Of the 511 A(H3N2) viruses characterized, 98 (19.2%) were A/Panama/2007/99-like and 413 (80.8%) were A/Fujian/411/2002-like.   Other reports. Low influenza activity was reported in Greece, Guyana, Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of China, Hungary, Morocco and Portugal. Argentina, Australia, Madagascar, Poland and Spain reported no influenza activity.  "
"2004","http://www.who.int/csr/don/2004_01_20/en/index.html"," Development of a vaccine effective against avian influenza H5N1 infection in humans - update 4   20 January 2004   The WHO influenza pandemic preparedness plan, issued in 1999, sets out a series of steps to be taken following confirmation of human infection with a new influenza virus subtype not yet spreading from person to person. One of these steps concerns the initiation of research needed for vaccine production.   As a precautionary measure, WHO is moving forward with the procedures needed to rapidly produce a new influenza vaccine capable of protecting humans against the H5N1 strain of avian influenza recently detected in Viet Nam. These procedures have been initiated following mounting concern over 5 laboratory confirmed human cases of H5N1 avian influenza in Hanoi, Viet Nam in recent weeks. All 5 cases were fatal.   The human deaths in Viet Nam coincide with historically unprecedented epidemics, in bird populations, of highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza in Viet Nam, the Republic of Korea, and Japan. The epidemic in birds is the first in Japan since 1925, and the first ever documented in Viet Nam and the Republic of Korea.   Prototype viruses for vaccine production are being prepared by laboratories in the WHO Global Influenza Network. Several laboratories in this network have the high-security (biosafety level 3) facilities needed to safely conduct work on a highly pathogenic virus such as H5N1. Prototype viruses are then supplied to manufacturers as the “seed stock” for vaccine production.   Laboratories in Hong Kong and Japan have isolated the virus from specimens obtained from two of the laboratory confirmed fatal cases in Viet Nam. The virus is now being analysed at the molecular level to obtain information about its origin and its relationship to viruses currently circulating in birds and possibly other animals. These studies will also determine the antigenic and genetic characteristics of the virus that are needed to produce a candidate vaccine.   Using laboratories in the WHO influenza network, and following procedures established by WHO to detect and respond to a new influenza virus subtype, a prototype virus could be made available to vaccine manufacturing companies within about four weeks.   Candidate vaccines were developed last year, by network laboratories in London, UK and Memphis, Tennessee, for protection against the H5N1 virus strain which caused two cases and one death in Hong Kong last February.   If the virus isolated from the fatal cases in Viet Nam proves sufficiently similar to the 2003 H5N1 strain in Hong Kong, the existing candidate vaccines could expedite the availability of a new vaccine. The candidate prototype vaccines have already undergone basic tests to ensure safety and effectiveness, genetic stability, and antigenic homogeneity.   Several steps are needed before a new influenza vaccine can be ready for use in humans. Virus for use in influenza vaccines is grown in chicken eggs. However, because H5N1 is so deadly in chicken embryos, a new technique, known as “reverse genetics”, is required to prepare the prototype H5N1 virus for vaccine production.   Reverse genetics merges selected genetic information of the virus taken from actual cases with a laboratory virus. The resulting virus is recognized by the human immune system, and causes a protective immune response, but no disease. The virus can also be genetically modified so that it is no longer lethal to chicken embryos. As a further advantage, use of the reverse genetics technique produces a prototype virus with predictable growth during vaccine production.   The prototype virus is then used by manufacturers to produce sample vaccines for clinical testing. WHO will offer support in the coordination of these clinical trials, which are needed to determine the amount of vaccine and number of doses required to confer protection, also in different age groups.   As part of its influenza pandemic preparedness plans, WHO also has in place procedures for making specific recommendations to vaccine manufacturing companies and licensing agencies for the composition and approval of a vaccine during an influenza pandemic.   The WHO Global Influenza Laboratory Network was established in 1947 to guide the yearly composition of influenza vaccines. The oldest disease surveillance network at WHO, it also operates as an early warning system for detecting conditions, including novel viruses, that could give rise to another influenza pandemic. Historically, influenza pandemics have spread rapidly around the world, causing high mortality and affecting all age groups, including young and healthy adults. The most severe pandemic in the previous century, in 1918–1919, killed an estimated 50 million persons.  "

The case occurred in an 8-year-old girl who died on 17 January in Hanoi, where she had been hospitalized since 15 January.   All five confirmed cases have been fatal. The first death occurred on 30 December 2003.  "
"2004","http://www.who.int/csr/don/2004_01_16/en/index.html"," Avian influenza A(H5N1) in humans in Viet Nam and in poultry in Asian countries - update 2   16 January 2004   As detailed in a fact sheet issued yesterday, epidemics of highly pathogenic avian influenza, recently reported in some Asian countries, need to be watched very closely because of their potential significance for human health. All reported bird epidemics, in the Republic of Korea, Viet Nam, and Japan, are now known to have been caused by an H5N1 strain of avian influenza viruses.   Earlier this week, laboratory tests confirmed the presence of the H5N1 variant in samples taken from three patients hospitalized with severe respiratory disease in Hanoi, Viet Nam. Today, laboratory tests have confirmed the presence of H5N1 in an additional Vietnamese patient. All four confirmed cases have been fatal.   Several other patients with respiratory illness are under investigation in Hanoi. A case definition of avian influenza in humans is being introduced to facilitate the detection of further cases in Viet Nam, and surveillance is improving as a result.   Apart from its severe impact on bird populations, this H5N1 variant has properties that make it a potential risk to human health of considerable significance. H5N1 virus recently isolated from Asian birds has been shown to mutate rapidly and has a known tendency to acquire genes from influenza viruses affecting other species.   Moreover, the simultaneous occurrence of large and highly fatal outbreaks of H5N1 in birds is considered unprecedented. WHO is concerned that these events may indicate that H5N1 is becoming established in birds in this part of the world. Because comprehensive surveillance to detect all cases in bird species is difficult, the true geographical occurrence of the avian epidemic may not be fully appreciated at present.   The outbreak in Viet Nam is of particular concern as it suggests the presence of many conditions that are known to have favoured the start of influenza pandemics in the past. Foremost among these is the co-circulation of human influenza viruses with an avian strain that is prone to mutate and has high pathogenicity. H5N1 has, on two occasions in the recent past, caused severe disease with high fatality in humans, and has done so again during the past three weeks.   Widespread epidemics in birds increase opportunities for human exposure. Increases in the number of infections in humans increase opportunities for the avian and human strains to exchange genetic material. If a new virus subtype emerges as a result, and if that virus proves capable of spreading easily and sustainably from person to person, then the conditions for the start of an influenza pandemic will have been met.   The H5N1 variant isolated from fatal human cases in Viet Nam was partially sequenced earlier this week. All genes are of avian origin, indicating that the virus had not yet acquired genes from the human influenza virus. The acquisition of such genes increases the likelihood that a virus of avian origin can be readily transmitted from person to person.   In response to these concerns, WHO and its partners have intensified activities needed to reach three main objectives: to reduce death and disease among humans due to H5N1, to reduce opportunities for a new influenza pandemic to emerge, and to initiate urgently needed international and national research. Specific lines of research will allow a better scientific assessment of the significance of ongoing epidemics in birds for human health in affected countries, and possibly elsewhere.   Laboratories in the WHO global influenza network are now conducting studies, at the molecular level, of viruses isolated from infected birds in the different countries, and from the human cases. Such molecular “detective work” can help identify the origins of currently circulating viruses, determine how they might be related, and thus shed considerable light on how the viruses are evolving.   Despite the seriousness of the current outbreak in humans, WHO believes that it can be controlled, provided decisive measures are taken to eliminate the animal reservoir for human infections. Surveillance for human respiratory disease in this part of the world has been intensified. WHO has alerted countries regarding the need to intensify surveillance for animal infections. Culling of infected or potentially exposed poultry flocks is a standard control measure that has proved effective in halting past epidemics of avian influenza in several countries.   H5N1 is the only one of the 15 subtypes of avian influenza that has, to date, caused severe outbreaks in humans. In Hong Kong in 1997, H5N1 caused disease in 18 persons, of whom 6 died. In February, 2003, H5N1 infected two persons, causing the death of one.   Three incidents of human infection with other avian subtypes, namely H7N7 and H9N2, were documented in 1999 and 2003, but caused only mild illness and altogether only 1 death.   During the 1997 outbreak of H5N1 influenza in humans, the culling – within three days – of Hong Kong’s entire poultry population is thought, by many experts, to have averted an influenza pandemic.  "
"2004","http://www.who.int/csr/don/2004_01_14/en/index.html"," Avian influenza A(H5N1) in humans in Viet Nam and poultry in Asia - update   14 January 2004   Investigation of cases of acute respiratory illness are continuing in Viet Nam with support from WHO staff. The investigation has been undertaken in response to concerns over the laboratory confirmation, on Sunday, of the presence of avian influenza virus H5N1 in three patients who died of severe respiratory illness in late December and early January.   The H5N1 strain implicated in the outbreak has now been partially sequenced. All genes are of avian origin, indicating that the virus that caused death in the three confirmed cases had not yet acquired human genes. The acquisition of human genes increases the likelihood that a virus of avian origin can be readily transmitted from one human to another.   Investigations are focusing on the source of infection and possibilities of human-to-human transmission.   An outbreak of highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza was detected in southern Viet Nam in the beginning of January. The outbreak is now known to have spread to other provinces in the country. Reports indicate that pigs and ducks have also been infected.   Yesterday, officials in the Republic of Korea announced the spread of H5N1 avian influenza to an additional farm. Japan is also experiencing an outbreak in poultry caused by the H5N1 virus.   In response to these developments, WHO has initiated a series of activities. These include support to national authorities in investigating the outbreaks and enhanced surveillance activities in Asia. WHO has also initiated the development of candidates and reagents for vaccine production, and antigenic and genetic assessments of the H5N1 strain to provide up-to-date diagnostic tests to national influenza centres.   The WHO Global Influenza Network will receive virus and clinical specimens shortly. As a precautionary measure, network laboratories will immediately begin work on the development of a strain that can be used to produce a vaccine.  "

Compared with the significant increase in previous weeks, influenza A(H3N2) activity seemed to be levelling off although, in several central and eastern European countries (Croatia, Latvia and Switzerland), it continued to increase. So far this season influenza B activity has been low and reported only from Asian countries (Republic of Korea and Thailand).   Most influenza infections this season have been attributed to influenza A(H3N2) viruses. The majority of A(H3N2) viruses antigenically characterized so far have been A/Fujian/411/2002-like; the others have been A/Panama/2007/99-like.   Following last week’s update on the A(H5N1) outbreak in the Republic of Korea , no more farms have been reported to be infected by avian influenza A(H5N1) viruses. The National Influenza Centre in the Republic of Korea has finished sampling sera from persons in contact with suspect infected animals and nearby residents, and will start serological studies shortly.   Avian influenza virus A(H5N1) has been identified as the cause of an outbreak of avian influenza in two southern provinces of Viet Nam; there is also information on outbreaks of avian influenza in other provinces. The virus, which spreads rapidly and has a mortality approaching 100% in chickens, has resulted in the deaths of 40 000 chickens and the culling of 30 000 more. Pigs and ducks are also reported to have been infected.   Since the end of October 2003, hospitals in Hanoi and surrounding provinces have admitted 14 persons with severe respiratory illness – 13 children and one adult (the mother of a deceased child). To date, 11 of the children and the adult have died. The National Institute of Hygiene and Epidemiology in Viet Nam and the National Influenza Centre in Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of China (Hong Kong SAR) confirmed that three of these cases were infected with avian influenza A(H5N1) viruses. At present, there is no evidence that human-to-human transmission is occurring, and no health care workers have been infected. More information is available on the WHO web site .   Belgium. Influenza A(H3N2) activity declined in week 1 (28 December 2003 to 3 January 2004) in terms both of the number of viruses identified and of the influenza-like illness (ILI) consultation rate. Canada. In week 1, widespread influenza activity was reported in Ontario, Quebec, Newfoundland and some parts of British Columbia. Overall ILI consultation rate dropped from 79 cases per 1000 consultations in week 52 of 2003 to 36 cases per 1000. Of the 456 influenza viruses antigenically characterized by the National Microbiology Laboratory to date, 429 (94%) were A/Fujian/411/2002-like, 25 (6%) were A/Panama/2007/99-like, one was an A/New Caledonia/20/99 (H1N1)-like virus and one was A(H1N2).   Croatia. Influenza A(H3N2) activity increased significantly in week 1, with 6 influenza A(H3N2) and 9 A non-subtyped viruses identified.   Czech Republic. Influenza A(H3N2) activity remained localized in week 1, with ILI consultation rate below the baseline level.   Finland. Influenza A(H3N2) activity remained widespread in week 1, but with a significant decrease in the number of laboratory-confirmed influenza cases since week 52 of 2003.   France. Influenza activity continued to decline in France, although widespread influenza A(H3N2) activity still persisted in many regions.   Denmark. Influenza A(H3N2) activity was reported as widespread in week 1, when the ILI consultation rate declined after being above the epidemic threshold for 3 weeks. Germany. A continuing slight increase of regional influenza activity was observed in week 1.   Israel. Influenza activity has been in decline since week 51 of 2003.   Latvia. Influenza activity remained at a low level, but with a slight increase since week 49 of 2003.   Norway. After a peak in weeks 49 and50, clinical and virological indicators showed that influenza A(H3N2) activity, while still widespread in most parts of the country, declined gradually in week 1. Of 882 influenza A virus detected so far, 187 have been subtyped as A(H3) and 26 as A(H1). All A(H3) strains antigenically characterized were A/Fujian/411/2002-like, and all A(H1) strains were A/New Caledonia/20/99-like.   Portugal. Influenza activity remained sporadic in week 1 with 1 influenza A(H3N2) virus detected.   Republic of Korea. Influenza B activity has been reported since week 49.   Romania. Influenza A(H3N2) activity has declined rapidly since week 52 and was reported as sporadic in week 1.   Switzerland. Influenza A(H3N2) activity was reported as widespread in week 1, with an increase in the ILI consultation rate in all regions of the country.   United Kingdom. Influenza activity continued to decline in week 1, with a falling ILI consultation rate reported in Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales. In England, the ILI consultation rate increased slightly, probably because of the disruption of service over the Christmas and New Year period. During week 1, no influenza virus was detected. Of the viruses antigenically characterized, 102 (95.3%) have been confirmed as A/Fujian/411/2002-like, 3 as A/Panama/2007/99-like and 2 as B/Hong Kong/330/2001-like.   United States. The overall ILI consultation rate (6.2%) decreased for the first time this season; the percentage of specimens testing positive for influenza and the number of states reporting widespread influenza activity also decreased. However, pneumonia and influenza mortality (9.4%) continued to increase and exceeded the epidemic threshold (8.0%). Widespread influenza activity was reported in 38 states, New York City and the District of Columbia, and regional activity was reported in 9 states during week 1. Of the specimens tested, 20.7%were positive for influenza, with 635 influenza A viruses and 6 B viruses identified. Since week 40, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta have antigenically characterized 2 influenza A(H1) viruses, 454 A(H3N2) viruses and 5 B viruses from the USA. Of the 454 A(H3N2) viruses characterized, 98 (21.6%) were A/Panama/2007/99-like and 356 (78.4%) are A/Fujian/411/2002-like.   Other reports. Low influenza activity was reported in Greece, Hong Kong SAR, Italy and Japan. Argentina and Poland reported no influenza activity.  "
"2004","http://www.who.int/csr/don/2004_01_13/en/index.html"," Avian influenza A(H5N1) in humans and poultry in Viet Nam   13 January 2004 Laboratory results received on Sunday have confirmed the presence of avian influenza virus strain A(H5N1) in samples taken from humans. The samples were taken from two children and one adult admitted to hospital with a severe respiratory illness in Hanoi.   Since the end of October, hospitals in Hanoi and surrounding provinces have admitted 14 persons with severe respiratory illness. The cases are in thirteen children and one adult, the mother of a deceased child. To date, eleven of the children and the adult have died.   It is not known whether all of these cases were caused by the same pathogen. At present, there is no evidence that human-to-human transmission has occurred. No reports indicate that health care workers have been infected.   The presence of avian influenza A(H5N1) in samples from three of these cases was confirmed by Hong Kong’s National Influenza Center, which is a member of the WHO Global Influenza Surveillance Network. Samples have also been sent for analysis to Japan’s National Institute for Infectious Diseases, another member of the WHO influenza network. Results are awaited shortly.   WHO is providing support to Vietnamese health authorities in their investigation of the cases and in the prevention of further spread to humans.   Avian influenza strains normally infect birds exclusively.   The first cases of human infection with avian influenza A(H5N1) were identified in 1997 in Hong Kong. The virus infected 18 persons and caused 6 deaths. Genetic studies subsequently linked the outbreak in humans to an outbreak of highly pathogenic avian influenza in poultry. The immediate culling of around 1.5 million poultry in Hong Kong is thought to have averted a larger outbreak in humans.   Other recent outbreaks of avian influenza in humans have caused limited disease. An outbreak of H5N1 in Hong Kong in February 2003 caused 2 cases and 1 death. An outbreak of H7N7 avian influenza in the Netherlands caused the death of one veterinarian in April 2003, and mild illness in 83 humans. Mild cases of avian influenza A(H9N2) in children occurred in Hong Kong in 1999 (two cases) and in mid-December 2003 (one case).   Highly pathogenic avian influenza in poultry Last week, avian influenza virus A(H5N1) was identified as the cause of an outbreak of highly pathogenic avian influenza in two southern provinces of Viet Nam. To date, the virus, which spreads rapidly and has a mortality in chickens approaching 100%, has resulted in the deaths of 40,000 chickens and the culling of 30,000 more.   The relationship between the human and poultry outbreaks of avian influenza A(H5N1) in Viet Nam is not fully understood at present. WHO and Viet Nam’s Ministry of Health are undertaking investigations to determine the source of the human cases and whether human-to-human transmission has occurred. The situation is also being followed closely by the country’s Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development.   An outbreak of avian influenza A(H5N1) occurred in South Korea in December 2003. On Monday, Japanese authorities announced the death of 6,000 chickens at a single farm as due to infection with the same strain of the virus. These outbreaks mark the first cases of avian influenza in South Korea, and the first cases in Japan since 1925.   No human cases of infection with the avian influenza virus have been reported in either of these outbreaks.   WHO regards every case of transmission of an avian influenza virus to humans as a cause for heightened vigilance and surveillance. The circulation of highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses in large numbers of poultry in a growing number of countries is of particular concern. Influenza viruses are highly unstable. The co-circulation of highly pathogenic animal viruses with human viruses could create opportunities for different species-specific viruses to exchange genetic material, giving rise to a new influenza virus to which humans would have little, if any, protective immunity.

"2004","http://www.who.int/csr/don/2004_01_08/en/index.html"," Update 3: Announcement of suspected SARS case in southern China; Investigation of source of infection for confirmed case begins tomorrow   8 January 2004   Health authorities in China have today announced a suspected case of SARS in the southern province of Guangdong. The patient, who has been treated under isolation since 31 December, is a 20-year-old woman from Henan Province who works at a restaurant in Guangzhou, the provincial capital city.   The patient felt unwell on 25 December, developed a fever the following day, and sought medical treatment on 31 December. In line with diagnostic and management protocols issued by the Chinese Ministry of Health, she was immediately placed in isolation. She was diagnosed as a suspected case following review by a panel of Chinese SARS experts. Epidemiological investigations and laboratory tests are under way. The patient has been afebrile for the past seven days and is said to be in stable condition.   Altogether 100 contacts have been traced and placed under medical observation. At present, no signs or symptoms suggestive of SARS have developed in any of these contacts.   The announcement follows Monday’s laboratory confirmation of SARS in a 32-year-old male resident of Guangzhou. The man has fully recovered and has been discharged from hospital. All close contacts of the patient, including health care workers, have remained in good health throughout the observation period, which has now ended.   At present, no epidemiological evidence has linked the confirmed case with the suspected case. The possible source of exposure in both cases is under investigation.   Symptoms of SARS mimic those of several other respiratory diseases, including many that are more frequently seen during the winter months. Some of these diseases may also give rise to atypical pneumonia. It is likely that numerous other suspected cases will be reported over the coming weeks.   All currently available SARS diagnostic tests have shortcomings. In view of these limitations, WHO recommends that specimens taken from suspected SARS cases for laboratory analysis include nasopharyngeal aspirates and stool samples as well as serum. Each specimen should be divided into samples at the bedside, rather than in a laboratory where the risk of contamination is heightened. When positive or inconclusive results are obtained, one of the samples should be sent for independent testing at a WHO-designated SARS reference laboratory.   Investigative team arrives in Guangdong A joint team of WHO and Chinese experts has arrived today in Guangdong to investigate possible sources of infection for the confirmed SARS case. Over the coming days, parallel investigations will look at possible human-to-human, animal-to-human, and environmental sources of transmission. Further information about the team is provided on the web site of the WHO Regional Office for the Western Pacific.   Animal experts will also examine conditions surrounding the culling of masked palm civets and other wildlife species, and make recommendations for research that could shed light on the origins of the SARS coronavirus.   The SARS virus, which first emerged in Guangdong in mid-November 2002, is thought to have jumped to humans from some unidentified animal or environmental reservoir. Further research is urgently needed to determine sources of human exposure, including the possible involvement of specific animal species.   An investigation by a previous joint team of experts, conducted in Guangdong from 20 December to 2 January 2004, found a very high level of awareness of the symptoms of SARS among health care workers and pharmacists, and a very high level of preparedness to introduce appropriate public health measures. Good levels of infection control were in place at all four facilities where the confirmed case was examined or treated. Local and national authorities were rapidly alerted, and the tracing of 81 contacts was completed within 2 days.  "
"2004","http://www.who.int/csr/don/2004_01_07/en/index.html"," Human influenza activity still increasing in many countries and moving eastwards - update 6   7 January 2004 Disease Outbreak Reported   Summary   (weeks 51 and 52, 14–27 December 2003)   Influenza activity associated with A/Fujian/411/2002-like viruses continued to increase in some countries in central and eastern Europe (Czech Republic, Finland, Greece, Israel, Russian Federation, Switzerland and Ukraine), but declined in many western European countries (Belgium, France, Norway, Portugal, Spain and the United Kingdom) as well as in Canada. In the USA, influenza activity persisted at a high level. Sporadic activity of influenza A(H3N2) and B was reported in some countries/regions in Africa (Algeria and Madagascar) and Asia (Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of China, Japan and Thailand).   Most influenza infections this season have been attributed to influenza A(H3N2) viruses. The majority of A(H3N2) viruses antigenically characterized so far have been shown to be A/Fujian/411/2002-like; others have been A/Panama/2007/99-like.   Following an initial avian influenza A(H5N1) outbreak on a chicken farm in the Republic of Korea , avian influenza spread to 14 other farms. A further 18 farms were under surveillance. Since 23 December 2003, only one more farm, which had been under surveillance from the beginning because of its location, has been confirmed as infected by avian influenza A(H5N1) viruses. About 2500 serum samples were collected from persons in contact with suspect infected animals and nearby residents. A serological study will be carried out in mid-January 2004. About 70 human clinical specimens were tested by RT-PCR and all were negative. More than 1000 persons exposed to the virus were given antivirals and some 1500 other individuals were vaccinated.   The isolated, single case of H9N2 that occurred in Hong Kong SAR in December 2003 has been further investigated. Sera from the infected boy and family members have been tested in Hong Kong SAR for the presence of antibodies against the H9N2 virus and confirmatory tests are in progress. Serum samples have also been shipped to a WHO Collaborating Centre. Around 120 serum samples were collected from health care workers and other contacts of the infected boy and test results should be available early in the week beginning 12 January. The H9N2 virus isolated from the boy in December 2003 has been sequenced by the National Influenza Centre at the Governmental Virus Unit, Hong Kong SAR and antigenically characterized by WHO Collaborating Centres. The results confirm that the virus is from the G9 group and closely related, though not identical, to previous H9 strains. The WHO H9N2 test kit, distributed to national influenza centres, allows detection of this H9N2 virus.   Belgium (20 December 2003) . In week 51, influenza activity of A(H3N2) was reported as widespread for the 4th week running, but the number of viruses detected decreased.   Canada (20 December 2003) . During week 51, widespread influenza activity continued in Ontario, while a continuing decline in activity was observed in the Northwest Territories and Saskatchewan. The influenza-like-illness (ILI) consultation rate was below the baseline. During week 51, 17.0% of 771 laboratory tests were positive for influenza A and 0.2% were positive for influenza B. Of the 374 influenza viruses antigenically characterized by the National Microbiology Laboratory to date, 347 (93%) were A/Fujian/411/2002-like, 25 (7%) were A/Panama/2007/99-like, one was an A/New Caledonia/20/99 (H1N1)-like virus and one was A(H1N2).   Czech Republic (20 December 2003) . A slight but continuing increase of influenza A(H3N2) activity has been noted since week 48. Localized influenza activity was reported in week 51, with 8 influenza A viruses detected.   Finland (20 December 2003) . Influenza A(H3N2) activity continued to increase in week 51 and was reported as widespread for the 3rd week. All viruses subtyped so far were antigenically related to A/Fujian/411/2002-like viruses.   France (27 December 2003) . Activity of influenza A(H3N2) continued to be widespread but appeared to have stabilized or to be declining in most regions.   Germany (27 December 2003) . A slight increase in influenza activity was observed in weeks 51 and 52, with localized activity reported.   Greece (27 December 2003) . Influenza activity increased significantly in week 52; 17 influenza A(H3N2) and 1 A(H1N1) viruses were detected.   Israel (27 December 2003) . Influenza activity remained at a high level in weeks 51 and 52 although the number of viruses detected started to decline.   Latvia (27 December 2003) . Influenza activity remained at a low level, but an upward trend has been noted since week 49.   Mexico (20 December 2003) . Localized activity of influenza A viruses continued in week 51 for the 3rd week running.   Norway (27 December 2003) . Widespread influenza activity continued to be reported in weeks 51 and 52, but the incidence of ILI decreased slightly; the number of laboratory-confirmed cases also appeared to be levelling off after several weeks of substantial increase. While influenza A(H3) activity was reported in all health regions, A(H1) activity was confined to south-east Norway. Of 753 influenza A viruses detected so far, 163 were subtyped as A(H3), and 25 as A(H1). All A(H3) strains antigenically characterized were A/Fujian/411/2002-like, and all A(H1) strains were A/New Caledonia/20/99-like.   Portugal (27 December 2003) . The widespread activity of influenza A(H3N2) that had lasted for 5 weeks began to decline rapidly in week 51. In week 52, influenza activity was reported as sporadic with no viruses detected.   Russian Federation (27 December 2003) . Influenza activity continued to increase in weeks 51 and 52 and was reported as widespread in most regions. Most of the influenza viruses detected were A(H3N2). The Influenza Ecology and Epidemiology Centre antigenically characterized 15 influenza A(H3N2) viruses in the second half of December 2003: 10 were A/Fujian/411/2002-like and 5 were A/Panama/2007/99-like.   Spain (27 December 2003) . Influenza activity continued to decline in weeks 51 and 52 with an ILI consultation rate of 63 per 100 000 population, which is below the baseline.   Switzerland (27 December 2003) . Influenza activity continued to increase and was reported as widespread in weeks 51 and 52. All influenza A(H3) viruses antigenically characterized so far were A/Fujian/411/2002-like.   Ukraine (27 December 2003) . Influenza activity continued to increase in weeks 51 and 52, especially in northern and eastern parts of the country where widespread activity was reported. Both influenza A(H3N2) and A(H1N1) viruses were detected.   United Kingdom (27 December 2003) . Influenza activity continued to decline in weeks 51 and 52. The ILI consultation rate was within the baseline range in England, Scotland and Wales. In Northern Ireland, the ILI rate was also declining. During week 51, 5 influenza viruses were detected; no viruses were detected in week 52. Of the viruses antigenically characterized so far, 83 (94.3%) have been confirmed as A/Fujian/411/2002-like, 3 as A/Panama/2007/99-like and 2 as B/Hong Kong/330/2001-like.   United States (27 December 2003) . The overall ILI consultation rate continued to increase (9.4%), and the pneumonia and influenza mortality (9.0%) was above the epidemic threshold (7.9%) for week 52, although the number of states reporting widespread influenza activity decreased. Widespread influenza activity was reported in 42 states, New York City and the District of Columbia, and regional activity was reported in 8 states during week 52. Of the specimens tested, 28.1% were positive for influenza, with 984 influenza A viruses and 4 B viruses identified. Since week 40, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta have antigenically characterized 2 influenza A(H1) viruses, 357 A(H3N2) viruses and 2 B viruses.

"2004","http://www.who.int/csr/don/2004_01_05/en/index.html"," Laboratory confirmation of a SARS case in southern China - update 2   5 January 2004 Results from laboratory tests received today have confirmed a case of SARS in a 32-year-old man in the southern Chinese province of Guangdong. The patient is a television producer who has been under treatment, in isolation, at a hospital in the provincial capital, Guangzhou, since 20 December.   This is the first confirmed case of SARS in 2004, and the first case not linked to a laboratory accident that has occurred since the initial outbreak of SARS was declared contained on 5 July 2003. Laboratory-related cases occurred after that date in Singapore in September and in Taiwan, China in December of last year.   The Guangdong case has been under investigation, with WHO support, since 26 December, when the suspected case was initially reported by Chinese authorities. Previous diagnostic tests produced inconclusive results. In view of the limitations of SARS diagnostic tests, confirmation of positive results by a WHO-designated reference laboratory is required for a definitive diagnosis of SARS.   The confirmatory tests were conducted in Hong Kong by both the University of Hong Kong at the Queen Mary Hospital and the  Government Virus Unit of the Department of Health. Both laboratories are members of the WHO Multicentre Collaborative Network for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) Diagnosis that collectively identified the SARS coronavirus in mid-April 2003, and have considerable diagnostic expertise.   The source of infection for this newly confirmed case remains unclear. Several lines of investigation last year suggest that SARS may have originated from contact with wild animals sold for human consumption at live markets in southern China. Studies conducted last year detected a SARS-like virus in some animal species, including the masked palm civet. Retrospective analysis of patient records has linked several of the earliest cases, which began occurring in Guangdong in mid-November 2002, to contact with wild animals. However, no animal reservoir of the SARS coronavirus has been conclusively identified to date.   Epidemiological investigations in China have not yet been able to link the patient to exposure to wild animals or any other known or suspected source of the virus.   Chinese authorities have introduced several measures as investigation of the case has evolved. The patient has been treated in isolation since his hospitalization on 20 December, four days after the onset of symptoms. All contacts have been traced and followed up. All are reported to be free of symptoms and most have been released from quarantine, suggesting that no further transmission has occurred. Surveillance for additional cases has been intensified in Guangdong and other provinces.   The single isolated case does not constitute grounds for issuing a SARS alert or recommending any restrictions on travel or trade.   At the request of Chinese authorities, additional WHO teams are being sent this week to assist in research aimed at identifying the source of infection and preventing further cases.   The first cases of SARS occurred in Guangdong in mid-November 2002. The disease began to spread internationally in late February 2003, eventually causing more than 8000 cases, with 774 deaths, in 27 countries.  "

The case is a 41-year-old woman from the south-eastern province of Fujian.  She developed symptoms of fever followed by pneumonia on 6 December, and was admitted to hospital two days later.  The patient died on 21 December.   On 13 December, initial laboratory tests on samples from the patient tested negative for H5N1.  But further tests on 23 December – including PCR tests carried out at the Chinese Center for Disease Control in Beijing – showed positive results.  The virus was also isolated from the patient.   Close contacts who have been placed under medical observation have not displayed any symptoms, health authorities report.   Agricultural authorities so far have not been able to confirm the presence of the H5 virus subtype in poultry in the vicinity of the patient’s residence or place of work.  Investigators have not  been able to confirm any direct contact between the patient and poultry prior to the onset of illness.  The investigation, however, is continuing and answers to these and other questions are still being sought.   This is China’s seventh laboratory-confirmed human case.  Of these cases, three have been fatal (including this latest case).  To date, China has reported human cases in six provinces and regions: Hunan, Anhui, Guangxi, Liaoning, Jiangxi and Fujian.  "

The case is a 31-year-old female farmer from the north-eastern province of Liaoning. She developed symptoms on 30 October and subsequently underwent extensive hospital care for severe pneumonia and acute respiratory distress. She recovered and was discharged from hospital on 29 November.   Initial tests on this case produced negative results for infection with the H5 virus subtype. Diagnostic confirmation was made following antibody testing using a microneutralization test. Using this test, a positive diagnosis is made when antibody levels in a blood sample taken late in illness are at least four times higher than those found in a sample taken early in illness. Diagnostic confirmation using antibody tests, though reliable, is thus slower than that achieved using direct tests for virus RNA.   Beginning in late October, Chinese authorities have reported several outbreaks of highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza in poultry in Liaoning Province. Investigation of this case has linked the woman’s infection to direct exposure to diseased poultry. Agricultural authorities have detected the H5N1 virus in samples taken from poultry in the province.   As a precaution, local authorities placed contacts of the woman under medical observation pending definitive laboratory results. No signs of influenza-like illness were detected, and all contacts have now been released from observation.   This is China’s fifth laboratory-confirmed case. Of these cases, two were fatal. The cases have been reported from four provinces: Anhui, Hunan, Guangxi, and Liaoning.   Thailand   The Ministry of Public Health in Thailand has confirmed a further case of human infection with the H5N1 avian influenza virus.

The largest and deadliest outbreak of Marburg haemorrhagic fever on record* In mid-March the Angola Ministry of Health (MOH) along with WHO actively investigated reports of 63 deaths (mostly children and three health care workers) among patients at the Uige Provincial Hospital, Angola. On 21 March, Marburg haemorrhagic fever was identified as the cause of the outbreak by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Following the laboratory confirmation, the MOH asked WHO to mobilize technical assistance and financial aid to help control the outbreak.   The international response to the outbreak in Angola began on 22 March. The team from WHO, included experts from the Inter-country programme for southern Africa, the Regional Office for Africa (AFRO) and from Headquarters, and partners in the Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network (GOARN). ( see below the list of partners and organizations who worked with the Ministry of Health to control the outbreak ). In addition Médecins sans Frontières (Belgium, France, Holland and Spain) assisted with infection control and established isolation facilities in Uige, Luanda, Songo and Negage hospitals.   The Angolan Government, WHO and other partners, established a surveillance system for identification of suspected cases and follow up of their contacts. Mobile teams were sent to the field to investigate rumours, obtain clinical specimens for laboratory tests, hospitalize suspected patients and monitor their contacts.   A portable field laboratory established by the Canadian National Microbiology Laboratory began operating in Uige on 4 April and a second laboratory operated by the US CDC in Luanda became operational on 10 April. Field laboratories provide rapid and sufficiently reliable results for use during an outbreak, when decisions about appropriate case management and contact tracing need to be made quickly.   The disease spread particularly among people exposed to the Marburg virus during home care or at funerals, via contact with body fluids of those who died from the disease. The dangerous use of home-based injections was also identified as a major cause of the outbreak's spread.   Early in the outbreak there was considerable confusion among the local population due to mistrust of the health-care system. Most preferred home-based care given by their traditional healers or family members. Intensive social mobilization campaigns were implemented successfully in the whole province to restore confidence and trust. A key element of the strategy was to include in the team traditional healers, pastors, teachers and community workers and to use a wide variety of communication formats. Guidance from two medical anthropologists, from the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique in Paris, who joined the outbreak control team was also critical for the community compliance with outbreak control measures.

In Romania, investigations of recent poultry deaths have, to date, identified the H5 subtype of avian influenza virus. Further testing is under way to determine the strain and whether the virus is highly pathogenic. Authorities in the two countries have undertaken control measures as recommended by OIE and FAO. WHO is sending diagnostic reagents and other supplies to support testing in national laboratories. Viruses from both outbreaks have been sent for further analysis to the Central Veterinary Laboratory Agency-Weybridge (UK), which is an OIE/FAO reference laboratory. Viruses are also being sent to WHO reference laboratories for comparison with human H5N1 isolates from Asia.   Public health implications   The spread of H5N1 to poultry in new areas is of concern as it increases opportunities for further human cases to occur. However, all evidence to date indicates that the H5N1 virus does not spread easily from birds to infect humans. WHO advises countries experiencing outbreaks in poultry to follow certain precautions, particularly during culling operations, and to monitor persons with a possible exposure history for fever or respiratory symptoms. The early symptoms of H5N1 infection mimic those of many other common respiratory illnesses, meaning that false alarms are likely.   The WHO level of pandemic alert remains unchanged at phase 3: a virus new to humans is causing infections, but does not spread easily from one person to another.   WHO continues to recommend that travellers to areas experiencing outbreaks of highly pathogenic H5N1 in poultry should avoid contact with live animal markets and poultry farms. Large amounts of the virus are known to be excreted in the droppings from infected birds. Populations in affected countries are advised to avoid contact with dead migratory birds or wild birds showing signs of disease.   Direct contact with infected poultry, or surfaces and objects contaminated by their droppings, is considered the main route of human infection. Exposure risk is considered highest during slaughter, defeathering, butchering, and preparation of poultry for cooking. There is no evidence that properly cooked poultry or poultry products can be a source of infection.   Countries located along migratory routes need to be vigilant for signs of disease in wild and domestic birds. Recent events make it likely that some migratory birds are now implicated in the direct spread of the H5N1 virus in its highly pathogenic form.  "

Until a conclusive diagnosis is made, these patients are classified by the Ministry of Health as suspect cases. While many do not have symptoms compatible with a diagnosis of H5N1 infection, screening of patient samples is being undertaken in national laboratories as part of efforts to ensure that no new cases are missed.   Laboratory testing to confirm human infection with H5N1 avian influenza is technically difficult; some tests produce inconclusive or unreliable results. To ensure a reliable assessment of the situation in Indonesia, authorities are, after initial screening, continuing to send samples from people considered likely to have H5N1 infection to WHO reference laboratories for diagnostic confirmation.   According to FAO, highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza is now endemic in poultry in many parts of Indonesia.

The case, in an 8-year-old boy, was confirmed as positive for H5N1 infection by a WHO reference laboratory in Hong Kong. The boy remains in hospital for observation and treatment. Current investigations in Indonesia have produced no evidence that the H5N1 virus is spreading easily from person to person.   Background on avian influenza in Indonesia   Since mid-2003, Indonesia has experienced outbreaks of avian influenza in its poultry population. Prior to the new case announced today, two human cases of H5N1 infection in Indonesia have been laboratory confirmed, one in July and another in September. All three cases have been investigated by the Indonesia health authorities, with WHO support, and  searches for further cases have been conducted.   As investigations have produced no evidence that the H5N1 virus is spreading easily from person to person, WHO has not raised its current level of pandemic alert. WHO will, however, continue to monitor the situation closely. Given the experience of other H5N1 affected countries in Asia, the detection of further human cases in Indonesia or elsewhere would not be surprising.   Laboratory confirmation of cases in Indonesia has led to heightened public concern, intensified surveillance for further cases, and strengthened government commitment to contain the disease. As a result, several patients with respiratory symptoms and a history of possible exposure to the avian virus are being evaluated as part of ongoing surveillance efforts. Samples from these patients have also been sent for analysis by the WHO reference laboratory in Hong Kong.   Overall assessment   In all affected countries, most human cases of H5N1 infection have been linked to contact with poultry. In a few instances, limited human-to-human transmission of the virus may have occurred following close contact with a patient during the acute phase of illness. In all known instances, such transmission has been limited and has not led to larger outbreaks in the general community, indicating that the virus does not spread easily among people at this time.   WHO has sent all countries a document outlining recommended strategic actions for responding to the avian influenza pandemic threat. Recommended actions aim to strengthen national preparedness, reduce opportunities for a pandemic virus to emerge, improve the early warning system, and accelerate vaccine development.

"2005","http://www.who.int/csr/don/2005_08_18/en/index.html"," Geographical spread of H5N1 avian influenza in birds - update 28  Situation assessment and implications for human health   18 August 2005   Beginning in late July 2005, official reports to the OIE from government authorities indicate that the H5N1 virus has expanded its geographical range. Both Russia and Kazakhstan reported outbreaks of avian influenza in poultry in late July, and confirmed H5N1 as the causative agent in early August. Deaths in migratory birds, infected with the virus, have also been reported. Outbreaks in both countries have been attributed to contact between domestic birds and wild waterfowl via shared water sources.   These are the first outbreaks of highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza recorded in the two countries. Both countries were previously considered free of the virus.   Since the initial reports, the Russian H5N1 outbreak in poultry, which has remained confined to Siberia, has spread progressively westward to affect 6 administrative regions. In Kazakhstan, several villages bordering the initial outbreak site in Siberia are now known to have experienced disease in poultry. To date, outbreaks in the two countries have involved some large farms as well as small backyard flocks, with close to 120,000 birds dead or destroyed in Russia and more than 9,000 affected in Kazakhstan.   In early August, Mongolia issued an emergency report following the death of 89 migratory birds at two lakes in the northern part of the country. Avian influenza virus type A has been identified as the cause, but the virus strain has not yet been determined. Samples have been shared with WHO reference laboratories and are currently being investigated. Also in early August, an outbreak of H5N1 in poultry was detected in Tibet, China.   In all of these recent outbreaks, authorities have announced control measures in line with FAO and OIE recommendations for highly pathogenic avian influenza. To date, no human cases have been detected, vigilance is high, and rumours are being investigated by local authorities.   The outbreaks in Russia and Kazakhstan provide evidence that H5N1 viruses have spread beyond their initial focus in south-east Asian countries, where outbreaks are now known to have begun in mid-2003. Despite aggressive control efforts, FAO has warned that the H5N1 virus continues to be detected in many parts of Viet Nam and Indonesia and in some parts of Cambodia, China, Thailand, and possibly also Laos. The south-east Asian outbreaks, which have resulted in the death or destruction of more than 150 million birds, have had severe consequences for agriculture and most especially for the many rural farmers who depend on small backyard flocks for income and food. Human cases, most of which have been linked to direct contact with diseased or dead poultry in rural areas, have been confirmed in four countries: Viet Nam, Thailand, Cambodia, and Indonesia. Only a few instances of limited human-to-human transmission have been recorded. Poultry outbreaks of H5N1 avian influenza in Japan, Malaysia, and the Republic of Korea were successfully controlled.   WHO fully agrees with FAO and OIE that control of avian influenza infection in wild bird populations is not feasible and should not be attempted. Wild waterfowl have been known for some time to be the natural reservoir of all influenza A viruses. Migratory birds can carry these viruses, in their low pathogenic form, over long distances, but do not usually develop signs of illness and only rarely die of the disease. The instances in which highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses have been detected in migratory birds are likewise rare, and the role of these birds in the spread of highly pathogenic avian influenza remains poorly understood.   Very large die-offs of migratory birds from avian influenza, such as the one detected at the end of April at Qinghai Lake in central China, in which more than 6,000 birds died, are considered unusual. Research published in July indicates that H5N1 viruses in that outbreak are similar to viruses that have been circulating in south-east Asia for the last two years.   Analyses of viruses from the Russian outbreak, recently published on the OIE website , show apparent similarity to viruses isolated from migratory birds during the Qinghai Lake outbreak. Specimens from the Mongolian outbreak in migratory birds should also prove useful in shedding light on these recent developments. Monitoring the spread and evolution of avian H5N1 viruses in birds and rapidly comparing these results with previously characterized H5N1 viruses is an essential activity for assessing the risk of pandemic influenza.   Implications for human health   The poultry outbreaks in Russia and Kazakhstan are caused by a virus that has repeatedly demonstrated its ability, in outbreaks in Hong Kong in 1997, in Hong Kong in 2003, and in south-east Asia since early 2004, to cross the species barrier to infect humans, causing severe disease with high fatality. A similar risk of human cases exists in areas newly affected with H5N1 disease in poultry.   Experience in south-east Asia indicates that human cases of infection are rare, and that the virus does not transmit easily from poultry to humans. To date, the majority of human cases have occurred in rural areas. Most, but not all, human cases have been linked to direct exposure to dead or diseased poultry, notably during slaughtering, defeathering, and food preparation. No cases have been confirmed in poultry workers or cullers. No cases have been linked to the consumption of properly cooked poultry meat or eggs.   Factors relating to poultry densities and farming systems seen in different countries may also influence the risk that human cases will occur. During a 2003 outbreak of highly pathogenic avian influenza, caused by the H7N7 strain, in the Netherlands, more than 80 cases of conjunctivitis were detected in poultry workers, cullers, and their close contacts, and one veterinarian died. That event, which was contained following the destruction of around 30 million poultry, underscores the need for newly affected countries to follow FAO/OIE/WHO recommended precautions when undertaking control measures in affected farms.   Pandemic risk assessment   The possible spread of H5N1 avian influenza to poultry in additional countries cannot be ruled out. WHO recommends heightened surveillance for outbreaks in poultry and die-offs in migratory birds, and rapid introduction of containment measures , as recommended by FAO and OIE. Heightened vigilance for cases of respiratory disease in persons with a history of exposure to infected poultry is also recommended in countries with known poultry outbreaks. The provision of clinical specimens and viruses, from humans and animals, to WHO and OIE/FAO reference laboratories allows studies that contribute to the assessment of pandemic risk and helps ensure that work towards vaccine development stays on course.   The expanding geographical presence of the virus is of concern as it creates further opportunities for human exposure. Each additional human case increases opportunities for the virus to improve its transmissibility, through either adaptive mutation or reassortment. The emergence of an H5N1 strain that is readily transmitted among humans would mark the start of a pandemic.  "

Of these human cases, 38 have been fatal. As reported by China, 18 patients are critically ill.   Virtually all cases have occurred in Sichuan Province, where infections with Streptococcus suis have been detected in pigs in a concurrent outbreak. The province has one of the largest pig populations in China.   Investigation and containment of the outbreak have been given high priority by Chinese authorities. The country’s ministries of health and agriculture are working in close collaboration, and WHO and FAO are being promptly informed of new developments.   Investigations conducted by Chinese epidemiologists indicate that the first human cases occurred at the end of June in Ziyang City, Sichuan Province. From 24 June through 21 July, the authorities reported 20 cases of illness, of unknown cause, admitted to three hospitals in that city. WHO was officially informed of the outbreak on 22 July, at which time 20 cases and 9 deaths had been reported.   Cases have since been reported in 11 prefectures in Sichuan Province. Most cases reported have occurred in adult male farmers. Information reported to WHO suggests that close contact with diseased or dead pigs is the principal source of human infection.   Symptoms reported by local clinicians include high fever, malaise, nausea, and vomiting, followed by meningitis, subcutaneous haemorrhage, toxic shock, and coma in severe cases. The incubation period is short and disease progression is rapid.   Local experts are conducting active searches for further cases. To date, Chinese authorities say they have found no evidence of human-to-human transmission.   The outbreak in humans has some unusual features and is being closely followed by WHO.

A 17-month old girl with a previous history of oral polio vaccine (OPV) developed fever and paralysis in both legs on 25 April, in the metropolitan area of the capital, Luanda.   Genetic sequencing of the type-1 wild poliovirus shows that it originated in India. Virological and epidemiological evidence suggest a recent importation. The affected child and her family have no travel history. An investigation did not detect spread beyond the community.   Outreach from routine immunization services has been stepped up in advance of the campaign. The national routine immunization coverage of children against polio is estimated to be 45%.   A nationwide polio vaccination campaign is planned 29-31 July. Authorities are considering the use of a combination of monovalent oral polio vaccine (mOPV) in the immediate area of the case and trivalent oral polio vaccine in the rest of the country for maximum impact.

"2005","http://www.who.int/csr/don/2005_06_30/en/index.html"," Avian influenza – situation in Viet Nam – update 24   30 June 2005   At the request of the Ministry of Health, WHO sent a team of international experts to Viet Nam last week to assess laboratory and epidemiological data on recent cases and determine whether the present level of pandemic alert should be increased. Team members were drawn from institutes in Australia, Canada, Hong Kong SAR, Japan, the United Kingdom, and the United States of America having extensive experience in the testing of avian influenza viruses in human clinical specimens.   The team completed its work on Wednesday and submitted its preliminary findings to the government. The team found no laboratory evidence suggesting that human infections are occurring with greater frequency or that the virus is spreading readily among humans. The current level of pandemic alert, which has been in effect since January 2004, remains unchanged.   Some reports now circulating suggest that WHO has downgraded its assessment of the pandemic threat. These reports are unfounded. The experts were specifically asked to search for evidence that could substantiate concerns raised first at a WHO consultation of international experts held at the beginning of May in Manila. That consultation considered suggestive findings, largely based on epidemiological observations, that the H5N1 virus had changed its behaviour in ways consistent with an improved, though not yet efficient, ability to spread directly from one human to another. The specific epidemiological observations considered included milder disease across a broader age spectrum and a growing number of clusters of cases, closely related in time and place.   More recently, testing of clinical specimens by international experts working in Viet Nam provided further suggestive evidence of more widespread infection with the virus, raising the possibility of community-acquired infection. These findings have not been confirmed by the present investigative team.   Firm evidence of improved transmissibility would be grounds for moving to a higher level of pandemic alert. Because of the huge consequences of such a change, WHO is following a cautious approach that combines heightened vigilance for new cases with immediate international verification of any suggestive findings.   Because the detection of H5N1 in clinical specimens is technically challenging and prone to errors, members of the investigative team took sophisticated laboratory equipment with them to Hanoi for on-site testing. Tests were performed using WHO-approved reagents and primers.   While these first results are reassuring, further retesting of clinical specimens will continue over the next few weeks to provide the most reliable possible foundation for risk assessment.  "

New cases are, however, continuing to occur with no known link to a previous case, suggesting that the surveillance system has not yet reached the efficiency needed to interrupt chains of transmission.   Local and international staff have continued to identify cultural practices that create opportunities for exposure to the virus and thus allow the outbreak to continue. Most recently, around 200 traditional healers have been trained in ways to reduce risks to themselves and their clients and given masks and gloves. To date, at least two traditional healers have died of Marburg haemorrhagic fever.

In addition, outbreaks of meningococcal meningitis in and around Delhi, India have been documented during 1966 and 1985. During 1966, 616 cases of meningitis were reported with case-fatality rate of 20.9%. The highest proportion of cases and deaths occurred in age group less than 1 year followed by that in 1-4 years. The male to female ratio was almost 3:1. Because of non-availability of reagents, grouping of N.meningitides could not be performed.   The outbreak in 1985 was bigger in magnitude, both in terms of cases and the geographical area affected. 6133 cases with 799 deaths (13%) were reported. The male to female ratio of cases was 3:1. All the isolates of N. meningitides belonged to subgroup A.   Isolated cases of meningococcal meningitis during 1985 were also reported from several other parts of India namely Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan, Sikkim, Gujarat, Jammu & Kashmir, West Bengal, Chandigarh, Kerala and Orissa.   In 1985 Bhutan was also hit by meningitis and 247 cases with 41 deaths were reported between September 1985 and March 1986.

"2005","http://www.who.int/csr/don/2005_04_29/en/index.html"," Marburg haemorrhagic fever in Angola - update 16   29 April 2005   As of 27 April, the Ministry of Health in Angola has reported 275 cases of Marburg haemorrhagic fever. Of these cases, 255 were fatal. In Uige Province, which remains the epicentre of the outbreak, 266 cases, of which 246 have been fatal, were reported as of 28 April.   With all control measures – teams, equipment, and protocols – needed to contain the outbreak now in place, extreme care must be taken to guard against any practices that could again amplify transmission. At this point in the outbreak, an amplification event would be a setback capable of extending the presently intense containment efforts for several weeks. During past outbreaks of viral haemorrhagic fevers, such events have historically resulted in an additional two transmission cycles and a second wave of cases.   Control operations in Uige have experienced some recent setbacks. On two occasions earlier this week, doctors at Uige’s large provincial hospital were directly exposed to blood from Marburg patients being treated on general wards, without adequate infection control. The doctors are under observation. These high-risk exposures should not have occurred.   Such incidents indicate that infection control procedures at the hospital have been seriously compromised. They occurred despite a system put in place, and supported by equipment and training, to safely screen new admissions for exposure history and fever and ensure the separation of possible cases from patients on the general wards.   In another recent incident, the body of a deceased patient was left, uncleaned and uncollected, on an open ward for more than eight hours, placing hospital staff and other patients at risk. In another incident, a severely ill baby admitted to the paediatric ward was placed in a cot, without disinfection, immediately after the body of another baby, who died from the disease, had been removed. In line with cultural practices, mothers are present on the paediatric ward and share the care of severely ill children, thus also sharing the exposure risk.   Under such conditions, amplification of transmission is highly likely to occur. Had safety protocols, set in place by the international team, been followed, none of these incidents would have occurred. Closing of the hospital has been considered but is not a viable option. Such a step would deprive many patients of potentially life-saving care while re-directing others to private clinics, where conditions and practices are even more unsafe and even more likely to result in additional cases.   Yesterday, the Minister of Health, accompanied by a vice-minister and the head of the WHO office in Angola, flew to Uige to investigate the situation, find solutions, and oversee their implementation. The officials have recognized that strong measures will be needed to ensure that patients admitted to the hospital for other conditions are not placed at risk of Marburg infection. The first steps to correct the situation were put in place today, and involve the collaboration of ministry officials, WHO, and Médecins Sans Frontières.   WHO has decided to strengthen the presence in Uige of international staff specialized in infection control. WHO welcomes the direct intervention of ministry officials. This high-level support should help ensure that containment measures, previously set in place and of proven efficacy, are restored and fully adhered to.   Investigation of several recent fatalities in Uige indicates a clear link between home-based treatments using unsafe syringes and spread of the virus. This problem is being addressed urgently. A massive door-to-door campaign, supported by banners and posters throughout Uige municipality, was launched yesterday to inform residents of the associated dangers and collect and safely destroy syringes. The campaign has continued today.  "

The cases were reported from Hudeida governorate in south-west Yemen, on the Red Sea coast. Prior to these cases, wild poliovirus has not been found in Yemen since AFP surveillance commenced in 1996.   Situation   On 4 April WHO Yemen was informed by Hudeida governorate health authorities of a cluster of acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) cases in children, the first cases of which had occurred in February 2005. The cases had been detected through AFP surveillance activities and investigated, including collection of stool specimens for laboratory investigation.   On 18 April, in close coordination with local health authorities, two teams of WHO and Ministry of Health experts, including epidemiologists and paediatricians, were dispatched to Hudeida governorate to further investigate the cluster of AFP cases.   On 20 April, results of testing of stool specimens of four of the cases by the polio network laboratory in Oman revealed wild poliovirus type 1. The laboratory and field investigation of other AFP cases is ongoing, and additional information will be made public as soon as it is available, including genetic information which will help identify the origin of the wild poliovirus responsible for the cases.   WHO Response   Yemen already conducted a nationwide immunization campaign on 13-15 April, to immunize all of the country's 4.5 million children under the age of five years. WHO is working with the Ministry of Health in Yemen to plan for further intensive house-to-house immunization activities in the immediate geographic vicinity of the cases. Planning for the next nationwide immunization campaign to be conducted in the second half of May is being intensified. Contingency plans for a potential third campaign in June are being discussed. Additional technical support is being provided for the continuing investigation and for planning for immunization rounds.   WHO is working with the Ministry of Health in Yemen to ensure that AFP surveillance throughout the country is sensitized so that no transmission of wild poliovirus is missed. Additionally, Ministries of Health of neighbouring countries have been informed.   Important note   The risk of importations into polio-free areas remains as long as polio exists anywhere in the world.

"2005","http://www.who.int/csr/don/2005_04_22/en/index.html"," Marburg haemorrhagic fever in Angola - update 15   22 April 2005   As of 20 April, the Ministry of Health in Angola has reported 266 cases of Marburg haemorrhagic fever. Of these cases, 244 were fatal. In Uige Province, which remains the epicentre of the outbreak, 253 cases, of which 233 have been fatal, were reported as of 21 April.   Assessment of the outbreak   The international response to the outbreak in Angola began one month ago, on 22 March. The features of Marburg haemorrhagic fever, and the conditions in Angola, have been an extreme test of international capacity to hold emerging diseases at bay. The outbreak in Angola is the largest and deadliest on record for this rare disease, which is presently showing a case fatality rate higher than 90%. For comparison, outbreaks of the closely related Ebola haemorrhagic fever have shown mortality rates ranging, according to the virus strain involved, from 53% to 88%. The only other large outbreak of Marburg, in the Democratic Republic of Congo from 1998 through 2000, had a case fatality of 83%.   Two factors make the rapid detection of outbreaks of Marburg haemorrhagic fever difficult: the extreme rarity of this disease and its similarity to other diseases seen in countries where deaths from infectious diseases are common. Neither the source nor the date of the initial cases in Angola can be presently identified with any certainty.   The number of cases began increasing in February and then, more dramatically, in March. On 21 March, Marburg virus was detected in patient samples sent to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta (USA), and WHO assistance was requested by the Ministry of Health in Angola. The operational response began the following day. As known from extensive experience with outbreaks of other viral haemorrhagic fevers, including Ebola, outbreaks of Marburg can be brought to an end using classic public health interventions. In theory, the measures needed to end the Angolan outbreak are few in number and straightforward in nature. Rapid detection and isolation of patients, tracing and management of their close contacts, infection control in hospitals and protective clothing for staff work to interrupt chains of transmission and thus seal off opportunities for further spread.   Such straightforward measures are complicated by the distinct features of this disease. The sudden onset, dramatic symptoms, and rapid deterioration of patients, and the absence of a vaccine and effective treatment, invariably incite great anxiety in affected populations. This anxiety, in turn, can interfere with control operations, especially when communities begin hiding cases and bodies because of suspicions about the safety of hospitals.   In the current outbreak, such suspicions are understandable. Very few patients with laboratory-confirmed Marburg haemorrhagic fever have survived; most hospitalized patients have died within a day or two following admission. For affected communities, staff from the mobile teams, fully suited in protective gear, are seen as taking away relatives and loved ones who may never again be seen alive.   WHO staff in Uige have today reported further signs that community attitudes are improving, though hostility towards the mobile teams remains of concern in one area known to have recent cases and deaths. Efforts to sensitize affected communities are continuing, with local volunteers supported by Portuguese-speaking experts from Brazil and Mozambique.   Conditions in Angola – a country weakened by almost three decades of civil unrest – have presented additional challenges. Supplies of water and electricity are intermittent, also in health care facilities. Weakened infrastructures, including those for communications and transportation, are another problem. Yesterday, the WHO office in Uige was informed of a death in another municipality, but was unable to collect the body for safe burial because of poor road conditions.   Fortunately, spread of the disease beyond Uige Province, located in the interior of the country, has been limited. Of the 266 cases and 244 deaths, 197 cases and 183 deaths occurred in Uige municipality. Other municipalities in Uige Province account for an additional 56 cases and 50 deaths.   WHO believes that the risk of international spread is low. No foreign nationals, with the exception of those involved in the direct care of patients, have been infected. There is no evidence that people can spread the virus before the onset of symptoms. Shortly after symptom onset, patients become rapidly and visibly very ill   WHO is optimistic that the outbreak can be controlled if present activities continue with sufficient vigour. All the essential containment measures are being applied with extensive international support, including more than 60 international staff drawn from institutions in the Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network, and the cooperation of national authorities and experts.   Tools and methods developed during international responses to outbreaks of other diseases have all been brought to bear on the present outbreak, and the success of this collaborative effort has surpassed initial expectations. Needs, which have ranged from satellite telephones and hand-held radio sets to vehicles, protective equipment, disinfectants, and specialized staff, have been rapidly communicated and immediately met.   WHO and its partners are nonetheless prepared and organized to continue the outbreak response for several additional months, if this is needed. An important present goal is to transfer skills and responsibilities for outbreak response to national staff, and training efforts are under way with this goal in mind.  "

A team of 28 Angolese health care professionals, assembled by the government, arrived today in Uige to provide further support to control activities. They have been assigned to work on infection control, surveillance for new cases, and the tracing and management of contacts, and are being trained and equipped for these tasks. The new staff will also join teams visiting communities within the affected municipalities in order to improve public understanding of the disease and acceptance of control measures. These teams are already supported by traditional community leaders, known as Sobas, and local volunteers.   Public understanding of the disease and participation in the outbreak response remain the most important factors influencing successful control. Activities needed to prevent further transmission within the hospital setting are well under way. In addition, protective gloves, soap, and instructions about the importance of their use have been provided to traditional healers and midwives.   Significant progress has been made in increasing the engagement of affected communities. Some cases and deaths have, however, continued to occur within the community. Efforts to rapidly isolate cases, shortly after symptom onset, and follow up contacts need to be further intensified.   Teams investigating recent deaths within the community have determined that some families providing care in their homes are administering injections to patients. This practice carries a high risk and can perpetuate transmission within the community. Educational messages and materials communicating the associated dangers were developed today and will be added to the information already being provided to communities.

Detailed data are available for Uige, the most severely affected province, where surveillance has been steadily improving. As of 14 April, 224 cases have been reported. Of these cases, 207 were fatal. Most cases have occurred in Uige municipality, which has reported 175 cases and 163 deaths. Much smaller numbers of cases have been reported from a further 7 municipalities in this province.   Improvement of public understanding of the disease and acceptance of control measures has become one of the most urgent priorities. Today, meetings were held in the WHO office in Uige with traditional community leaders, known as Sobas, for all of Uige municipality. The governor of the province and the director of its health services have released the Sobas from their present duties for seven days so that they can accompany mobile surveillance and medical teams as they search for cases and collect bodies.   This decision is welcomed as an important step forward in achieving community acceptance of measures needed to bring the outbreak under control. WHO staff in Uige now plan to systematically extend the same procedures, using locally respected Sobas, to all other municipalities known to be affected by the disease. This plan is supported by the authorities.   Training to protect staff at the provincial hospital from infection and reduce the risk of transmission is continuing. Today, training was provided for 82 nurses in high-risk departments, including the maternity ward and the laboratory. Heads of departments and doctors were trained yesterday. Training for health staff in private clinics and for health workers in the police force is planned for early next week.

Of these cases, 215 have died.   Uige Province remains the most severely affected area, reporting a cumulative total of 208 cases and 194 deaths. The isolation ward at the province’s large 400-bed hospital, which has been specially equipped and staffed for the care of Marburg patients, is empty, despite the fact that cases and deaths are known to be occurring in the community. It is apparent that, for the time being, the community does not accept the concept of isolation. Residents are unwilling to report suspected cases and allow these people to be managed under conditions that reduce the risk of further transmission.   Measures such as patient isolation and infection control that reduce opportunities for further transmission are the principal tools for bringing the outbreak under control. Given the urgency of the situation, WHO may temporarily introduce, as an emergency measure, a harm reduction strategy aimed at making a dangerous situation somewhat better. Family members and other caregivers who refuse to allow patients to be cared for in the isolation facility are being informed of ways to protect themselves from infection and given appropriate supplies. WHO has placed urgent orders for disinfectants, which are currently in short supply in Angola.   Today, international staff drawn from the Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network began training sessions for staff at the provincial hospital in the use of equipment and supplies to reduce the risk of infection in the health care setting. This training, which has been very well received, will continue through Saturday. Fever-screening units are being established to ensure that all persons admitted to hospital are initially screened for symptoms of Marburg haemorrhagic fever before being admitted to the general hospital wards.   Apart from continuing security concerns, another pressing problem is poor access to remote communities in Uige Province and correspondingly poor surveillance for cases in these areas. With the assistance of a military helicopter, international staff have begun pre-positioning supplies and equipment needed for outbreak control in these areas so that a response can be launched immediately should cases begin to occur.   In a tragic development, four Red Cross volunteers, freshly trained in social mobilization, were killed today by lightning while on their way to work. Support from Red Cross volunteers has been instrumental in controlling large outbreaks of the closely related Ebola haemorrhagic fever. WHO recognizes the importance of this support and deeply regrets the death of these volunteers.  "

Of these cases, 210 have died. Uige Province, with 202 cases and 190 deaths, remains the most severely affected area.   The present outbreak of Marburg haemorrhagic fever is unprecedented in its size and urban nature, and its dimensions are still unfolding. Although surveillance to detect cases has improved, it remains patchy. In Uige, where daily mobile teams are active, surveillance continues to be largely concentrated on the investigation of deaths and collection of bodies. The security of teams remains a concern. More vehicles are needed and WHO is making the necessary arrangements on an urgent basis.   To bring the outbreak under control, the detection and isolation of patients needs to be much earlier, but this will not happen until the public understands the disease and the high risks associated with treating patients in homes. Infection control needs to improve in heath care settings, and WHO is continuing to supply effective personal protective equipment, for both national and international staff, adapted to conditions in African countries.   A welcome development is the decision by the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies to strengthen its presence in Uige. Volunteers from these societies are part of a group of workers mobilized to conduct a door-to-door public information and education campaign in collaboration with community and church leaders and traditional healers. Today, workers received specialized training from experts in social mobilization and medical anthropology drawn from the Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network. These workers have been rapidly deployed to deliver public talks at markets and schools.   The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies has extensive experience in responding to emergencies in Africa and has been instrumental in bringing large outbreaks of Ebola under control. Because of this experience, workers from the Federation are usually viewed by communities as welcome help. WHO anticipates that this added and welcome support to response activities will help create greater acceptance of control measures and reduce high-risk behaviours.   Advice for travellers   All currently available data indicate that casual contact plays no role in the spread of Marburg haemorrhagic fever. Transmission requires extremely close contact involving exposure to blood or other bodily fluids from a patient who will most likely be showing visible signs of illness. The disease can also be transmitted following exposure to items, including bedding and clothing, recently contaminated by a patient.   In addition, transmission can occur in hospitals lacking adequate equipment and supplies for infection control and training in their proper use. The hospital system in Angola has suffered from almost three decades of civil unrest, and several cases of Marburg haemorrhagic fever have occurred in health care staff exposed during the treatment of patients in Uige.   To date, WHO is not aware of any cases of Marburg that have occurred in foreign nationals other than those involved in the care of cases in Uige.   WHO does not recommend restrictions on travel to any destination within Angola, but does advise some precautions. Travellers to Angola should be aware of the outbreak of Marburg haemorrhagic fever and of the need to avoid close contact with ill persons. Persons with existing medical conditions who might require hospitalization should consider deferring non-essential travel to Angola, particularly to Uige Province.   Those travelling to Angola for the purpose of working in health care settings should be fully informed regarding the outbreak of Marburg haemorrhagic fever, equipped with effective personal protective equipment, and trained in the procedures to prevent transmission in such settings.   Travellers leaving Angola should be advised to seek medical attention should any illness with fever develop within 10 days of their departure. Information about recent travel to Angola should be included when symptoms are reported.   Health care workers and health authorities in countries neighbouring Angola should be aware of the symptoms of Marburg haemorrhagic fever and maintain vigilance for cases. Countries having close ties with Angola, necessitating frequent travel there by their citizens, may want to consider the introduction of measures to increase vigilance for potential symptoms in persons returning from Angola. In some cases, the introduction of screening procedures to identify potentially infected persons may be considered.   WHO recommends that travellers with a clear exposure history be treated as contacts and placed under surveillance for 21 days, during which time their temperature should be monitored daily.  "

The girl became ill with a fever on the 29th March. Her condition deteriorated rapidly on 7 April, when she was taken to a district referral hospital and then transferred to Kuntha Bopha Hospital in Phnom Penh, where she died. Samples from the girl tested positive for avian influenza H5N1 virus at the Pasteur Institute, Phnom Penh.   A field investigation was conducted immediately, with team members from the Ministry of Health, Ministry of Agriculture, WHO, Pasteur Institute and FAO. Poultry deaths occurred in this village in February, but no poultry deaths occurred in the two weeks prior to the girl’s onset of symptoms. Human-to-human transmission as a source of the girl’s infection appears unlikely, as none of her known contacts were sick with similar symptoms before she became ill. Investigations as to the source of the girl’s infection are continuing.   Samples were collected from four close contacts who cared for her at the village and nine medical contacts from Kampot and Phnom Penh. All have tested negative for the H5N1 virus.   The public education campaign in Banteay Meas and neighbouring districts is continuing. The recent funding from international donors will be crucial in helping Cambodia control this disease.

Of these, 194 have died. Uige Province remains the epicentre of the outbreak, accounting for almost 90% of the cases and deaths.   In Uige, mobile surveillance teams resumed operations on Saturday following intensive campaigns to improve public understanding of the disease. Campaigns have benefited from support by the provincial governor and officials from the health department, who have made personal visits to affected communities. Religious leaders are also helping to sensitize the public.   Some improvements are already apparent. More alerts to suspected cases and deaths are being reported directly by residents. Some 360 contacts are being followed up by the teams in Uige, but more improvements are needed to detect cases earlier, ensure their isolation and supportive care, and find and manage contacts.   WHO is concerned that deaths are continuing to occur within the community, as care of patients by family members without adequate protective equipment greatly increases the risk of further transmission. Staff at Uige’s large provincial hospital also need training and equipment to reduce the risk that routine surgical and laboratory procedures might endanger staff and other patients.   An isolation ward, dedicated to the care of Marburg haemorrhagic fever patients, has been established at this hospital by Médecins sans Frontières. Concern arises from the risk that persons infected with the virus might be admitted for another suspected illness and undergo testing or treatment procedures without adequate precautions.   WHO experience with outbreaks of viral haemorrhagic fevers, including the closely related Ebola, underscores the importance of rapidly sealing off opportunities for the amplification of transmission within health care settings.

Of these, 180 have died. Zaire Province has reported its first 6 cases, bringing the number of affected provinces to seven, all concentrated in the north-western part of the country.   Mobile surveillance teams in Uige were forced to suspend operations yesterday when vehicles were attacked and damaged by local residents. As the situation has not improved, no surveillance teams were operational today in this province, which remains the epicentre of the outbreak.   WHO staff in Uige were notified today of several fatalities but teams were unable to investigate the cause of death or collect the bodies for safe burial. Discussions have been held with provincial authorities to find urgent solutions.   The dramatic symptoms of Marburg haemorrhagic fever and its frequent fatality are resulting in a high level of fear, which is further aggravated by a lack of public understanding of the disease. Moreover, because the disease has no cure, hospitalization is not associated with a favourable outcome, and confidence in the medical care system has been eroded.   WHO is familiar with such reactions, which have been seen during previous outbreaks of the closely related Ebola haemorrhagic fever. Two medical anthropologists are already in Uige and will be joined shortly by experts in social mobilization from Angola, the Democratic Republic of Congo, and Mozambique. Public compliance with control measures is not expected to improve in the absence of intense campaigns to educate the public about the disease.   In African countries, the single most important factor in controlling viral haemorrhagic fevers is the engagement of affected communities as partners in control. To achieve this engagement, local belief systems about the causes of disease and traditional rituals for mourning the dead must be respected. When the public understands and accepts a few simple messages – avoid contact with blood and other fluids when caring for the ill, don’t touch bodies of the deceased – transmission within the community can be stopped and the outbreak brought under control.   International appeal   Specialized international staff and equipment have been deployed rapidly and measures are beginning to have an impact. Control of the outbreak will require intensified and sustained technical support from multidisciplinary teams, and additional materials and supplies. Provision of adequate personal protective equipment is a particularly urgent need. Increased field coordination of technical, operational and logistic support is likewise needed.   Today, WHO has launched an appeal, through the United Nations, for funding to support the emergency response to this outbreak. WHO needs US$ 2.4 million to support the Ministry of Health, Angola to intensify ongoing operations in the field.   To reduce the risk of transmission in the community, priority activities include intensive social mobilization and health education in the towns and villages of Uige Province. To reduce the risk of transmission in health care facilities, priorities include the provision of personal protective equipment for front-line staff and essential supplies for infection control, including disinfectants. Additional activities that urgently need to be strengthened include the early detection and isolation of cases and the tracing and follow up of contacts.  "

"2005","http://www.who.int/csr/don/2005_04_07/en/index.html"," Marburg haemorrhagic fever in Angola - update 8   7 April 2005   As of 6 April, 200 cases of Marburg haemorrhagic fever have been reported in Angola. Of these cases, 173 have died. Kuanza Sul has reported its first case, bringing the number of affected provinces to six, all concentrated in the north-western part of the country.   International diagnostic and laboratory support   For laboratory work, Marburg virus has been classified as an extremely hazardous pathogen and can be handled safely only in specialized high-containment laboratories. WHO has established an international network of expert laboratories for the diagnosis of Marburg and other viral haemorrhagic fevers. Within this network, laboratories in Canada, Germany, South Africa, and the USA are providing diagnostic support for the Angolan outbreak. All have experience in working with Marburg virus.   Scientists from these laboratories are sharing test results and information on laboratory techniques in a virtual network and during weekly teleconferences. To ensure accurate tracking of the outbreak, members of the network are also standardizing methods for sample collection, testing, and the interpretation of results. The various diagnostic tests for Marburg haemorrhagic fever require skilled technical interpretation, as findings can vary according to the phase of the patient’s illness, the way in which samples were taken, and the type of test used.   In Angola, a portable field laboratory is now operating in Uige and a second one should be operational in Luanda shortly. Field laboratories provide rapid and sufficiently reliable results for use during an outbreak, when decisions about appropriate case management and contact tracing need to be made quickly. The laboratory network is providing backup support for situations in which exceptionally precise diagnostic results are important because of the implications for control measures. Such situations include the possible exportation of a case to another country, and a suspected case in a person who may have placed numerous other people at unusually high risk.   Sophisticated laboratory studies of the virus may help shed some light on certain unusual features of the outbreak, including the high fatality rate and the overwhelming concentration of initial cases in children under the age of five years. In this regard, comparisons of the virus with strains from previous outbreaks may be instructive.   A longer-term objective, whose achievement has long proved elusive, is to determine where Marburg virus hides in nature between outbreaks. Studies of viruses from Angola may offer some clues. Prior to the present outbreak, Angola was not considered to fall within the geographical “hot zone”, thought to be in central and eastern Africa, for outbreaks and sporadic cases of this rare disease.   Laboratories in the Marburg virtual network include:  Canadian National Microbiology Laboratory,Winnipeg, Canada and field laboratory in Uige, Angola  Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Special Pathogen Branch, Atlanta, USA and field laboratory in Luanda, Angola  Bernhard-Nocht-Institut für Tropenmedizin, Hamburg, Germany  Institut für Virologie, Marburg, Germany  National Institute for Communicable Diseases of the National Health Laboratory, Special Pathogens Unit, Sandringham, South Africa.

"2005","http://www.who.int/csr/don/2005_04_06/en/index.html"," Marburg haemorrhagic fever in Angola - update 7   6 April 2005   As of 5 April, the Angolan Ministry of Health has reported 181 cases of Marburg haemorrhagic fever. Of these, 156 have died. Cases have now been reported from five provinces. Uige remains the epicentre of the outbreak. While children under the age of 5 years initially accounted for around 75% of cases, recent cases are including an increasing number of adults.   One person is currently under investigation for Marburg haemorrhagic fever in the Democratic Republic of Congo.   Assessment of the outbreak   WHO is concerned about the further evolution of the outbreak of Marburg haemorrhagic fever in Angola, and this concern is fully shared by the government. Following confirmation of Marburg virus as the causative agent, on 21 March, WHO sent its senior epidemiologists to Uige to assess the situation and organize an initial emergency response. That assessment prompted a rapid and massive augmentation of support in the form of international teams of specialized staff, presently in Uige and Luanda, and several shipments of supplies. Staff have been drawn from WHO and its partners in the Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network (GOARN). Equipment to strengthen local diagnostic and communication capacity is also now in place.   This escalation of support is continuing, with the government making great efforts to facilitate the rapid influx of staff and supplies and set up the basic infrastructure for a sustained emergency response.   WHO has acquired extensive experience in the successful control of viral haemorrhagic fevers, including Ebola, a closely-related disease that is clinically almost identical. Based on this experience, WHO remains confident that the outbreak can be brought under control. At the same time, however, the implementation of effective control measures faces several significant challenges, some of which may be unique to this outbreak.   Marburg haemorrhagic fever is an extremely rare disease that remains poorly understood. Information on the behaviour of Marburg virus once it enters a human population is sparse. As detailed in a fact sheet recently issued by WHO, the outbreak in Angola is one of only two large outbreaks of this disease that have occurred in indigenous African populations since the virus was first detected in 1967. The only other large outbreak, which began in late 1998 in the Democratic Republic of Congo, was confined to two sparsely populated villages in an isolated corner of the country, caused sporadic cases with small chains of transmission over two years, and never reached the intensity of transmission seen in just the past few weeks in Angola. The outbreak in Angola is not only the largest on record, with the highest fatality, but is also the first to occur in an urban setting.   Almost three decades of civil unrest have left Angola with a severely weakened health infrastructure, a hospital system in dire need of basic equipment and supplies, inadequate communication and transportation systems, and a population weakened by economic hardship. These weaknesses hamper containment efforts, which depend on active surveillance for cases, rapid detection and isolation in specially designated and equipped facilities, and rapid tracing of contacts.   Based on experiences with Ebola, control measures can have an immediate impact by interrupting chains of transmission. The eventual success of such measures depends on their sustained application, supported by efficient surveillance, and requires very good communication and transportation systems. Such systems are not presently available in Angola and cannot be established quickly. As another consequence of the country’s recent history, hundreds of thousands of landmines are thought to remain in the country, making transportation by rail and road precarious and necessitating air transport of staff and equipment.   Intensified surveillance in Uige over the past few days has determined that some patients are not being hospitalized and are dying within the community, creating an urgent need to organize services for the safe collection and burial of deceased persons.   Cases in health care workers point to the need to greatly increase supplies of protective equipment for front-line workers, particularly in hard-hit Uige and densely populated Luanda. WHO has arranged three shipments of this equipment to date; more shipments are on their way. Personal protective equipment is also being supplied by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Médecins sans Frontières, and UNICEF. Nonetheless, supplies still fall short of the need. The symptoms of Marburg haemorrhagic fever, and its rapid fatality in the majority of cases, can cause great anxiety in affected populations. This anxiety increases the risk that people in affected areas may flee to other areas, thus fanning wider spread. Moreover, control measures are socially disruptive and may further increase public unease. In Uige, there is some evidence of a reluctance to seek treatment or remain under care in hospitals. Efforts are urgently needed to strengthen the hospital system, restore public confidence, and thus improve compliance with control measures.   Numerous alerts are now being received each day, and teams from the Ministry of Health and WHO are being rapidly deployed to conduct investigations. Outcomes are reported daily by radio, and information about the evolution of the outbreak is improving.   The incubation period of this disease, which can be as short as 3 days, necessitates rapid and efficient contact tracing, and this has been made a priority. Good tracing and management of contacts helps to ensure that possible cases are isolated prior to the onset of symptoms, when the risk of transmission to others is highest. Other current priorities include the protection of front-line staff, strengthening of infection control in designated isolation wards, improved transportation of suspected cases to these wards, and public education to encourage protective behaviours and improve compliance with control measures.   In addition to these fundamental tasks, a top priority at present is to prevent the virus from establishing a foothold in densely populated urban or peri-urban parts of the country. For example, Uige, which is presently the epicentre of the outbreak, has around 500,000 inhabitants, but Luanda, where some cases have been reported, has a population close to 3 million. Response capacity in Luanda is being strengthened by the Ministry of Health, and WHO is increasing the number of international staff there as a support.   International collaboration   Over the past two weeks, WHO has provided support to the Ministry of Health from Headquarters, the Regional Office for Africa, and Country Offices in Angola and in Mozambique.

The cases concern a 5-year-old boy from the central province of Quang Binh, a 17-year-old girl from the northern province of Nam Dinh, and a 40-year-old woman from the northern province of Quang Ninh. The 17-year-old girl has died.   An earlier case has also been confirmed. These recently confirmed cases bring the total in Viet Nam since mid-December to 28.   WHO is aware of reports of suspected H5 avian influenza infection in five members of a family who are presently hospitalized in the northern port city of Haiphong. These cases, which include the parents and their three young daughters, are undergoing further investigation following initial tests indicating infection with the H5 subtype of avian influenza. Reports indicate outbreaks of avian influenza in poultry in the vicinity. Field investigation of this family cluster is under way.   The current outbreak of human cases in Viet Nam has included several clusters, mostly in family members, of cases closely related in time and place. Thorough investigation of all such clusters is essential to determine possible changes in the behaviour of the virus and thus support assessment of the risk of an influenza pandemic.   There is currently no evidence that the H5N1 virus is spreading easily from person to person. Rapid sharing with WHO of viruses from recent clusters of cases has become increasingly important. Analysis can determine whether any significant changes in the virus have taken place and provide further support for risk assessment.   Several media reports have recently covered rumours of a large outbreak of influenza-like illness in Quang Binh Province. The outbreak is presently under investigation by provincial and central health authorities. Samples have been taken for testing, and WHO is awaiting the results. The number of cases with influenza-like illness appears much smaller than initially reported by the media.   Cambodia   The Ministry of Health in Cambodia has today confirmed the country’s second human case of avian influenza.   The 28-year-old man, from Kampot Province, developed symptoms on 17 March and was hospitalized in Phnom Penh on 21 March. He died on 22 March. The same day, laboratory tests by the Pasteur Institute in Phnom Penh confirmed that the man was infected with H5 avian influenza virus. The Cambodian government immediately launched an investigation to search for possible additional cases and identify possible sources of exposure to the virus. The investigation team, which is continuing its work in Kampot Province, includes Cambodian Ministry of Health and Ministry of Agricultural officials joined by staff from the WHO country office and the Pasteur Institute in Phnom Penh. FAO is assisting the investigation of animal disease. Numerous deaths among chickens in the area have been reported and samples taken from sick chickens have tested positive for avian influenza. The results from the investigation indicate the deceased man had contact with sick poultry. An 18 year-old boy initially identified as an additional suspected case has tested negative for the avian influenza virus. Samples taken from twenty seven other people, including family contacts of the confirmed case and Phnom Penh medical staff involved in his care, have all tested negative for H5 avian influenza infection. Results from a further six people from Kampot Province have also tested negative for H5 influenza virus.   Cambodia’s previous case, a 25-year-old woman who died in late January, was also from Kampot Province but lived in another district.   The majority of poultry in Cambodia are raised in small backyard flocks in rural areas, making surveillance for outbreaks especially challenging. A campaign to educate rural populations about the dangers of contact with dead or diseased poultry is being undertaken by the government, with support from WHO.  "

"2005","http://www.who.int/csr/don/2005_03_23/en/index.html"," Marburg haemorrhagic fever in Angola - update   23 March 2005   Laboratory tests have identified Marburg virus as the causative agent in an outbreak of suspected viral haemorrhagic fever in Angola. Virus was detected 21 March in samples from nine of twelve fatal cases.   Retrospective analysis has now identified 102 cases in the outbreak, which dates back to October 2004. Of these cases, 95 have been fatal.   Most cases are presently concentrated in Uige Province in the northern part of the country (see map below).   Since the start of the outbreak, the monthly number of cases has progressively increased, but this increase could be the result of intensified surveillance. Around 75% of cases have occurred in children under the age of 5 years. Cases in adults include a small number of health care workers.   Marburg virus disease has no vaccine or curative treatment, and can be rapidly fatal. In the present outbreak, most deaths have occurred between 3 to 7 days following the onset of symptoms.   Past outbreaks indicate that close contact with bodily fluids of infected people, as may occur in health care settings or during burial practices, increases the risk of infection.   WHO is supporting efforts by the Ministry of Health in Angola to strengthen infection control in hospitals, to intensify case detection and contact tracing, and to improve public understanding of the disease and its modes of transmission.   Background   Marburg virus disease is an acute febrile illness accompanied by severe haemorrhagic manifestations. The disease has an incubation period of 3 to 9 days. In the earliest stage of infection, symptoms are non-specific and may be easily confused with more common diseases, including malaria, yellow fever, and typhoid fever. A severe watery diarrhoea, abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting are early symptoms, as are severe chest and lung pains, sore throat, and cough. A high proportion of cases develop severe haemorrhagic manifestations between days 5 and 7, most frequently affecting the gastrointestinal tract and the lungs. A characteristic rash usually appears at this time, sometimes involving the whole body.   The disease was first identified in 1967 during simultaneous outbreaks affecting laboratory workers in Marburg and Frankfurt, Germany and in Belgrade, Yugoslavia. The outbreaks, which involved 31 cases and seven deaths, were subsequently linked to contact with infected monkeys imported from Uganda.   The virus then disappeared until February 1975, when an acutely ill man with a recent travel history to Zimbabwe was admitted to a hospital in South Africa. Infection spread from the man to his travelling companion and a nurse at the hospital. The man died, but the other two cases recovered.   In 1980, two cases, one of which was fatal, occurred in Kenya. In 1987, an additional single case, which was fatal, occurred in Kenya.   The largest outbreak on record, which occurred from late 1998 to late 2000 in the Democratic Republic of Congo, involved 149 cases, of which 123 were fatal. The outbreak was initially concentrated in workers at a gold mine in Durba.   Marburg virus disease occurs very rarely and appears to be geographically confined to a small number of countries in the southern part of the African continent. When cases do occur, the disease has epidemic potential, as it can spread from person to person, most often during the care of patients. For this reason, strict measures for infection control need to be applied during the management of cases. Containment of an outbreak of Marburg virus disease also requires the rapid tracing and isolation of contacts. Health education is needed to inform communities of the risks associated with traditional burial practices.   Despite intensive investigations extending over several years, research has failed to find an animal reservoir of the virus or determine where it hides in nature between outbreaks.

WHO continues to work closely with the Vietnamese Ministry of Health to further investigate additional cases which may have occurred since 2 February. WHO will update its cumulative list of confirmed cases accordingly.   Earlier this year, staff from WHO, Japan’s National Institute of Infectious Diseases in Tokyo, and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, Georgia, USA, began working with health authorities in Viet Nam to improve the sensitivity and reliability of laboratory diagnostic tests. This activity, which aimed to upgrade laboratory capacity and included a training component, involved the retesting in Tokyo of specimens from several persons initially classified in Viet Nam in January as negative for H5N1 infection. Retesting detected H5N1 in specimens from seven persons. WHO is awaiting further details about these cases, including outcomes. Upon receipt of this information, WHO will also include these cases in the cumulative total for Viet Nam.   One additional case in Viet Nam, dating back to February 2004, has been identified retrospectively from specimens stored as part of a study of encephalitis (see the New England Journal of Medicine, 2005, 352:686-691). H5N1 infection, which was not considered in the diagnosis of this fatal case, was identified in November 2004 when specimens were submitted to a battery of tests. Specimens collected from other patients in this study are now being systematically tested for possible H5N1 infection.   Information on new cases is of greatest concern and WHO continues to gather as much data as possible on each new case. Such data are urgently needed at a time when many countries are intensifying their pandemic preparedness activities.  "

The investigation will explore possible sources of exposure and look for signs of illness in family members, other close contacts, and the general community.   In view of the six-day interval between dates of symptom onset in the mother and her child, limited human-to-human transmission, as seen during similar events in the past, cannot be ruled out at this stage. All such clusters of cases, closely related in place and time, require urgent investigation to determine whether the epidemiological behaviour of the virus might be changing in ways that could favour the onset of a pandemic.   If confirmed by the Ministry of Health, these latest two cases will bring the total in Viet Nam reported since mid-December to twelve. To date, nine of these cases have been fatal.   WHO is again emphasizing the need for family members caring for H5N1 patients to follow recommended protective measures.   Since human cases of H5N1 were first reported in January 2004, no cases have been reported in health care workers or in professionals undertaking culling activities. Their continued adherence to recommended protective measures is equally important.  "
"2005","http://www.who.int/csr/don/2005_01_26/en/index.html"," Avian influenza – situation in Viet Nam – update 6   26 January 2005   The Ministry of Health in Viet Nam has today reported two further laboratory confirmed cases of human infection with H5N1 avian influenza in Viet Nam.   The first newly reported case is a 35-year-old woman from the southern province of Dong Thap. She developed symptoms on 14 January, was admitted to hospital on 20 January, and died the following day.   The second newly reported case is a 17-year-old boy from the southern province of Bac Lieu. He was hospitalized on 10 January and died on 14 January.   These additional cases bring the total in Viet Nam since mid-December to ten. Nine of these cases were fatal.   The recent family cluster in northern Viet Nam  As announced previously, a family cluster in northern Viet Nam has been the focus of intense investigation. The cluster involves three brothers. Of these, Vietnamese authorities have identified influenza A H5 infection in two: a 46-year-old man and his 42-year old brother. The older brother developed symptoms on 26 December and died on 9 January. The younger brother was hospitalized with respiratory symptoms on 12 January and has now fully recovered. He is known to have provided bedside care for his older brother during a period of critical illness.   The source of infection for the two brothers remains undetermined and investigations are ongoing. The third brother, aged 36 years, was hospitalized for observation only, did not develop symptoms, and remains in good health. Results of tests, conducted as part of the investigation, are pending. Clinical specimens for the two confirmed cases are being sent to a WHO collaborating centre for further characterization.   Surveillance for further cases among health care workers, other family members, and residents in both communities where the brothers lived has so far found no evidence of additional cases. If limited human-to-human transmission has occurred, all evidence at this stage suggests that the chain of transmission ended after a single person was infected.   Preventing transmission during care by family members   Further sporadic human cases and occasional family clusters can be expected considering the current spread of outbreaks of highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza in poultry in some Asian countries. Experience to date indicates that possible human-to-human transmission has occurred mainly during prolonged close contact of a family member with a patient who was critically ill. WHO has issued guidance on the precautions that can be taken in health care facilities to minimize opportunities for transmission of H5N1 infection from patients to close contacts, including health care workers and family members.   Rapid detection and investigation of clusters of H5N1 cases, closely related in time and place, are key surveillance activities that can provide an early alert to possible changes in the transmissibility of the virus.

"2005","http://www.who.int/csr/don/2005_01_21/en/index.html"," Avian influenza – situation in Viet Nam – update 5   21 January 2005   Laboratory results have confirmed avian influenza infection (H5 virus subtype) in two brothers in the northern part of Viet Nam. The first case, a 46-year-old resident of Thai Binh Province, developed symptoms on 1 January. He died on 9 January.   Avian influenza – situation in Viet Nam – update 4   His 42-year-old brother, a resident of Hanoi, developed symptoms on 10 January, nine days after his brother fell ill. He remains hospitalized in Hanoi and is recovering. He is known to have provided bedside care for his brother, who was treated at the same hospital in Hanoi. The investigation surrounding the new cases is considering two hypotheses.   The first one includes the possibility that the 42-year-old man may have acquired his infection directly from his brother. All evidence to date suggests that isolated instances of limited, unsustained human-to-human transmission can be expected from avian influenza viruses in humans.   Their occurrence does not call for any change in the present level of pandemic alert. Intensified surveillance for respiratory symptoms in close contacts of the two men has been initiated in both Thai Binh Province and Hanoi and it is reassuring that no cases of respiratory illness have so far been detected among these people.   Health authorities in Viet Nam have launched an immediate investigation of the source of infection in the two brothers. WHO staff in that country are being kept closely informed.   The second hypothesis is focusing on a possible direct source of poultry-to-human transmission. Preliminary findings point to a family meal in which a dish containing raw duck blood and raw organs was served.   Public health officials in Viet Nam have repeatedly advised against the consumption of dishes made with fresh duck blood or with raw or inadequately cooked poultry products. As a precautionary measure, similar culinary practices involving dishes containing raw poultry parts or organs should be avoided in all countries experiencing outbreaks of highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza in poultry.   To date, most human cases linked to contact with poultry are thought to have acquired their infection following exposure to dead or diseased birds around households. Evidence suggests that particularly risky exposure occurs during the slaughter, defeathering, and preparation of poultry for cooking.   Proper cooking destroys the H5N1 virus. In general, WHO recommends that poultry should be cooked until all parts reach an internal temperature of 70 o C. No cases of H5N1 infection have been linked to the consumption of thoroughly cooked poultry and egg products.   Avian influenza: food safety issues   Media reports that a third 35-year-old brother has been hospitalized have not been confirmed.   These latest two cases bring the total in Viet Nam since mid-December 2004 to eight. Of these, seven have died.

Tsunami in South-East Asia and the risk from avian influenza   Concerns have been raised about whether the recent tsunami in South-East Asia may have increased the risk of an influenza pandemic. The level of pandemic risk depends on how widespread H5N1 is in domestic poultry, how often the virus is transmitted to humans, and the concurrent circulation of human influenza viruses. Areas with the highest prevalence of avian influenza were not directly affected by the tsunami, thus there is no inherent increased risk of the emergence of the pandemic strain due to the tsunami itself. However, any activity that spreads avian influenza increases the possibility of the emergence of a pandemic virus. The risk of importing avian influenza into areas affected by the tsunami can be minimized by controlling the movement of poultry from areas where outbreaks of avian influenza have occurred. It is also important to ensure that infected poultry are kept out of the food chain, including emergency food relief activities.  "

These cases occurred in March and May 2006.   The first case occurred in a five-year-old male from East Bekasi, West Java Province. He developed symptoms on 4 March 2006, was admitted to hospital on 6 March, and died on 19 March. Test results, using two different assays, showed high antibody titer for H5N1 on consecutive serum samples taken on days 11 and 15 of his illness. These test results are consistent with new WHO criteria for laboratory confirmation. A field investigation at the time found that the case was exposed to diseased poultry in the vicinity of his home, where some birds tested positive for the H5 virus subtype.   The second case is a 27-year-old male from Solok, West Sumatra Province. This case was identified during the tracing of contacts of the man’s sister, a 15-year-old female who developed symptoms on 17 May 2006 and was subsequently confirmed to be H5N1 infected. Her brother spent six days caring for her during her hospital stay. The brother developed mild symptoms of cough and abdominal discomfort, with no fever, on 28 May 2006; his symptoms remained mild and he recovered within a few days.   Despite his mild and atypical symptoms, the brother was tested as part of the Ministry of Health’s protocol for contact tracing and the management of any contacts with symptoms.

The case occurred in a 35-year-old woman from the remote subdistrict of Cikelet, West Java Province. She  developed symptoms on 8 August, was hospitalized with severe respiratory disease on 17 August and died shortly after admission.   She is the third confirmed case from this sub-district to be reported in the past week.   Preliminary findings from the Cikelet investigation   A team of experts is presently in the Cikelet subdistrict investigating the outbreak and monitoring for further cases. Three hamlets are the focus of investigation.   The Cikelet subdistrict consists of around 20 isolated hamlets, each with a population of around 200 to 400 persons, many living in large extended families. The hamlets sit in a basin surrounded by steep mountains with rocky winding paths best accessed by foot or horseback.   In this area, mortality from endemic diseases, especially malaria, is common, access to health care is poor, and medical records of deaths are scanty or non-existent.   Prior to late June 2006, no mass die-offs of poultry are known to have occurred in the area. At that time, live chickens were purchased from an outside market in preparation for a religious feast and were integrated into local flocks. Shortly thereafter, chickens began dying in large numbers in an outbreak that continued throughout July and the first week of August, gradually spreading from one hamlet to another.   As the population had no experience with this disease, high-risk behaviours commonly occurred during the disposal of carcasses or the preparation of sick or dead birds for consumption. These exposures are, at present, thought to be the source of infection for most confirmed or suspected cases.   Deaths from respiratory illness are known to have occurred in late July and early August, but no samples were taken and medical records are generally poor. Though some of these undiagnosed deaths occurred in family members of confirmed cases, the investigation has found no evidence of human-to-human transmission and no evidence that the virus is spreading more easily from birds to humans.   The cooperation of residents is good, house-to-house surveillance for febrile illness is continuing, and specimens have been taken from symptomatic persons and sent for testing. The team is well-supplied with antiviral drugs, and these are being administered prophylactically to close contacts of cases and therapeutically to persons showing symptoms of influenza-like illness.

Recent chicken deaths were reported in her household.   Three hamlets within the village are currently under investigation. An additional case from the village, but from another hamlet, was confirmed by the Ministry of Health on 14 August. This 17-year-old male developed symptoms on 26 July and is now recovering. Another death from severe respiratory disease occurred on 5 August in a 20-year-old neighbour, who is also now known to be a cousin. As no samples were taken for testing, the cause of his illness remains uncertain. Based on epidemiological and clinical findings, however, infection with the H5N1 virus is strongly suspected.   As both young men developed symptoms on the same day (26 July), epidemiologists assume that they acquired their infection from a shared environmental source. The currently recognized incubation period for H5N1 infection of 2 to 8 days makes human-human transmission between the two highly improbable.   Teams from local health authorities, the Ministry of Health, and WHO are currently in the three hamlets investigating these cases and assessing the overall situation. Team members include experts in animal health. Recent die-offs of poultry are known to have occurred in the village, and all three cases described above had documented exposure to diseased chickens.   Heightened awareness in the hamlets, supported by the presence of well-equipped teams, has led to the presentation of additional persons for medical evaluation. Specimens have been taken and tests are being conducted. Rumours of additional deaths from respiratory disease in the hamlets in late July and early August are also being investigated.

The case occurred in a 24-year-old member of the military service based in Beijing. The man developed symptoms on 25 November 2003 and was hospitalized with pneumonia in Beijing. His condition deteriorated rapidly and he died of severe respiratory disease on 3 December 2003.   Confirmation of this case marks the earliest known instance of human H5N1 infection in mainland China, and is now the first confirmed case in the present outbreak. Previously, the first confirmed cases were thought to have occurred in Viet Nam in December 2003.   The case was initially reported by several Chinese researchers, affiliated with the military services, in a June 2006 letter to the New England Journal of Medicine. According to that communication, doctors initially suspected the man might have been infected with the SARS virus. Although WHO declared the SARS outbreak over in July 2003, suspicions were high that the virus might return during the cooler months.   Specimens tested for SARS infection prior to the man’s death were negative, but the cause of death remained undetermined. As stated in the published letter, stored specimens from the man subsequently tested positive for H5N1 infection. Successful isolation of the virus from these specimens was also reported.   As the man’s illness was initially thought to be SARS, no history of possible poultry exposure was taken. The source of his H5N1 infection remains uncertain, particularly as no poultry outbreaks of H5N1 avian influenza have been reported in Beijing.   The Ministry of Health informed WHO that it had been unaware of these tests and their results prior to publication of the research letter. In line with WHO recommendations, confirmatory testing in a laboratory affiliated with the Ministry of Health was arranged. Following an official request, WHO sent laboratory experts to consult with national experts performing the tests. That joint undertaking, conducted in late July, confirmed the man’s infection with the H5N1 virus. These findings were further reviewed by a panel of experts, which concluded that the man’s H5N1 infection was now laboratory confirmed.   Prior to this announcement, the first official laboratory-confirmed H5N1 case on the Chinese mainland occurred in Hunan Province in October 2005 and was reported to WHO in mid-November 2005.   The case has been added to the WHO cumulative table of confirmed cases. Retrospective confirmation of the case brings the cumulative total in China to 20. Of these cases, 13 have been fatal.

Data used in the analysis were collected for surveillance purposes. Quality, reliability and format were not consistent across data from different countries. Despite this limitation, several conclusions could be reached.  The number of new countries reporting human cases increased from 4 to 9 after October 2005, following the geographical extension of outbreaks among avian populations.  Half of the cases occurred in people under the age of 20 years; 90% of cases occurred in people under the age of 40 years.  The overall case-fatality rate was 56%. Case fatality was high in all age groups but was highest in persons aged 10 to 39 years.  The case-fatality profile by age group differs from that seen in seasonal influenza, where mortality is highest in the elderly.  The overall case-fatality rate was highest in 2004 (73%), followed by 63% to date in 2006, and 43% in 2005.  Assessment of mortality rates and the time intervals between symptom onset and hospitalization and between symptom onset and death suggests that the illness pattern has not changed substantially during the three years.  Cases have occurred all year round. However, the incidence of human cases peaked, in each of the three years in which cases have occurred, during the period roughly corresponding to winter and spring in the northern hemisphere.  If this pattern continues, an upsurge in cases could be anticipated starting in late 2006 or early 2007.   A more standardized collection of epidemiological data by countries and timely sharing of these data are needed to improve monitoring of the situation, risk assessment, and the management of H5N1 patients.

What is thought to be the first case is a 39-year old man with onset of paralysis on 8 May, later confirmed as infected with wild poliovirus type-1. The majority of suspect cases are over 20 years old; seven of the individuals have died.   National health authorities are planning a response to an outbreak of wild poliovirus in Namibia, polio-free since 1996. An investigation of the outbreak – which unusually appears to be affecting mostly adults – is currently under way. Genetic sequencing confirms that the virus is consistent with an importation from Angola, of Indian origin. Angola, polio-free since 2001, was re-infected last year by a virus from India.   The Government is planning an immunization response consisting of three National Immunization Days (NIDs), using monovalent oral polio vaccine type 1 (mOPV1). The first NID could be conducted as early as 21 June, and will aim to reach the entire population of the country (two million), rather than the usual under-five year population. The age of any further cases will dictate the target age groups for the two subsequent NIDs. An international team is in the country to assist the national authorities.   Namibia began routine immunization for polio in 1990. While the cause of the largely adult outbreak is yet to be determined, it is likely that those who fell ill did not receive immunization as children. Routine immunization coverage within Namibia today varies by region from 60% to 80%.  For more information   Global Polio Eradication Initiative   "

Two of the nurses cared for siblings, a 10-year-old girl and her 18-year-old brother, who were hospitalized in Bandung, West Java, on 22 May and died the following day. Test results for both nurses are negative for H5N1 infection. One nurse was shown to be infected with a seasonal influenza A (H1N1) virus, which is now circulating widely throughout Indonesia. The second nurse experienced only mild and transient symptoms, but was tested urgently as a precautionary measure. Her test results were also negative for H5N1 infection.   The two additional nurses, who work at a hospital in Medan, North Sumatra, were involved in the care of confirmed H5N1 cases among members of an extended family from the village of Kubu Simbelang in Karo District.

As of today, 54 surviving family members and other close contacts of cases have been identified and placed under voluntary home quarantine. All of these people, with the exception of pregnant women and infants, are receiving the antiviral drug, oseltamivir, for prophylactic purposes. Public health teams visit these people daily, checking for symptoms.   In addition, active house-to-house surveillance for influenza-like illness is being conducted throughout the village, which has around 400 households. A command post for fever surveillance has been functioning in the village since last week.   As of today, no new cases suggestive of H5N1 infection have been detected since 22 May. This finding is important as it indicates that the virus has not spread beyond the members of this single extended family . No hospital staff involved in the care of patients, in some instances without adequate personal protective equipment, have developed the disease. The last person in the cluster, who developed symptoms on 15 May and died on 22 May, refused hospitalization. He moved between two villages while ill, accompanied by his wife. The wife is under surveillance and has not developed symptoms.   Despite multiple opportunities for the virus to spread to other family members, health care workers or into the general community, it has not, on present evidence, done so.   Current level of pandemic alert   Based on an assessment of present evidence, WHO has concluded that the current level of pandemic alert is appropriate and does not need to change. The level of pandemic alert remains at phase 3. This phase pertains to a situation in which occasional human infections with a novel influenza virus are occurring, but there is no evidence that the virus is spreading in an efficient and sustained manner from one person to another.   WHO has recommended continued close monitoring of the situation in Kubu Simbelang for the two weeks following 22 May, the date when the last known case in the cluster died. As a precautionary measure, Indonesian authorities have decided to extend this recommended period to three weeks.   Preliminary results of the investigation   This information differs in some details from information released in previous updates, but is derived from extensive investigations by senior national and international epidemiologists, from WHO and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, who have developed a clearer picture of the situation.   The cluster involves an initial case and seven subsequent laboratory-confirmed cases. All cases are members of an extended family: sisters and brothers and their children. Family members resided in four households. Three households were next-door neighbours in the village of Kubu Simbelang, Karo District, North Sumatra. The fourth household was located about 10 kilometres away in the nearby village of Kabanjahe.   The initial case in the cluster was a 37-year-old woman who sold fruits and chillies at a market in the village of Tigapanah. Her stand was located about 15 metres away from a stand where live chickens were sold. The investigation uncovered no reports of poultry die-offs in the market. However, the woman kept a small number of backyard chickens, allowed into the house at night. Three of her chickens reportedly died before she became ill. She is also known to have used chicken faeces from these household chickens as fertilizer in her garden.   A parallel agricultural investigation has not, to date, detected H5N1 virus in PCR tests of approximately 80 samples from poultry, other livestock and domestic pets, and chicken fertilizer taken from the vicinity.   The initial case developed symptoms on 24 April, was hospitalized on 2 May, and died on 4 May. No samples were collected for testing prior to her burial, but she is considered part of the cluster as her clinical course was compatible with H5N1 infection.   The initial case had one sister and three brothers. The sister and two of the brothers subsequently developed infection. The remaining cases occurred among children in these families.   The confirmed cases include five males and two females with an average age of 19 years (range from 1 to 32 years). Six out of the seven confirmed cases developed symptoms between 3 May and 5 May. These cases include two sons of the initial case, her brother from Kabanjahe, her sister, the sister’s baby, and the son of a second brother living in an adjacent house. This second brother, the last case in the cluster, developed symptoms on 15 May. Six out of the seven cases were fatal.   Exposures   On the night of 29 April, nine family members spent the night in a small room with the initial case at a time when she was severely ill, prostrate, and coughing heavily. These family members included the initial case and her three sons; the brother from Kabanjahe village, his wife, and their two children; the 21-year-old daughter of another brother (who did not become infected); and another young male visitor. Following this event, three family members – the woman’s two sons and the visiting brother from Kabanjahe – developed symptoms from 5 to 6 days later.   The woman’s sister, who lived in an adjacent house, developed symptoms at the same time, as did her 18-month-old daughter. Prior to symptom onset, this sister, accompanied by her daughter, provided close personal care of the initial case.   The last case in the cluster provided close care for his son throughout his hospital stay, from 9–13 May. The son was a frequent visitor in the home of the initial case and was present there on 29 April.  "

The newly confirmed case is a brother of the initial case. Specimens were taken on 21 May and flown the same day to Jakarta. Tests run overnight confirmed his infection. His 10-year-old son died of H5N1 infection on 13 May. The father was closely involved in caring for his son, and this contact is considered a possible source of infection.   Although the investigation is continuing, preliminary findings indicate that three of the confirmed cases spent the night of 29 April in a small room together with the initial case at a time when she was symptomatic and coughing frequently. These cases include the woman’s two sons and a second brother, aged 25 years, who is the sole surviving case among infected members of this family. Other infected family members lived in adjacent homes.   All confirmed cases in the cluster can be directly linked to close and prolonged exposure to a patient during a phase of severe illness. Although human-to-human transmission cannot be ruled out, the search for a possible alternative source of exposure is continuing.   Both the Ministry of Health and WHO are concerned about the situation in Kubu Sembelang and have intensified investigation and response activities. Priority is now being given to the search for additional cases of influenza-like illness in other family members, close contacts, and the general community. To date, the investigation has found no evidence of spread within the general community and no evidence that efficient human-to-human transmission has occurred.   Analysis of viruses   Full genetic sequencing of two viruses isolated from cases in this cluster has been completed by WHO H5 reference laboratories in Hong Kong and the USA. Sequencing of all eight gene segments found no evidence of genetic reassortment with human or pig influenza viruses and no evidence of significant mutations. The viruses showed no mutations associated with resistance to the neuraminidase inhibitors, including oseltamivir (Tamiflu).   The human viruses from this cluster are genetically similar to viruses isolated from poultry in North Sumatra during a previous outbreak.  "

The case occurred in a 32-year-old man. He developed symptoms on 15 May and died on 22 May.   The case is part of a family cluster in the Kubu Sembelang village of North Sumatra. The man is the seventh member of an extended family to become infected with the H5N1 virus and the sixth to die. An additional person, who was the first member of the family to fall ill, died of respiratory disease on 4 May. No specimens were taken prior to her burial and the cause of her death cannot be determined. However, as her clinical course was compatible with H5N1 infection, epidemiologists at the outbreak site include this woman as the initial case in the cluster.   The newly confirmed case is a brother of the initial case. Specimens were taken yesterday and flown to Jakarta. Tests run overnight confirmed his infection. His 10-year-old son died of H5N1 infection on 13 May. The father was closely involved in caring for his son, and this contact is considered a possible source of infection.   Although the investigation is continuing, preliminary findings indicate that three of the confirmed cases spent the night of 29 April in a small room together with the initial case at a time when she was symptomatic and coughing frequently. These cases include the woman’s two sons and a second brother, aged 25 years, who is the sole surviving case in this family. Epidemiologists at the outbreak site believe this exposure may represent second-generation cases arising from limited human-to-human transmission. Other infected family members lived in adjacent homes.   Based on exposure histories and what is known about the incubation period of this disease, the most recently confirmed case is being investigated as possibly representing a third-generation case arising from limited human-to-human transmission.   Family members and village residents have not reported any recent large die-off of poultry or other livestock. No virus has been detected in samples taken from poultry, other animals, fertilizer, and other environmental sources in the village and neighbouring areas.   Both the Ministry of Health and WHO are concerned about the situation in Kubu Sembelang and are rapidly intensifying investigation and response activities. At present, all known cases can be directly linked to close and prolonged exposure to a patient during a phase of severe illness. No evidence points to spread within the general community or suggests that efficient human-to-human transmission has occurred.   Priority is now being given to the search for additional cases of influenza-like illness in other family members, close contacts, and the general community. The Ministry of Health has immediately strengthened its support to district health officials in the area. In collaboration with WHO, two operational hubs are being established to strengthen capacities in the areas of transportation, logistics, and communications and to support the deployment of more staff, should this be needed.   Indonesia has great experience in the field investigation of human cases, a close working relationship with WHO in Jakarta, and a good record of prompt and transparent reporting. Since the first case was reported in July of last year, each human case has prompted an immediate and thorough field investigation, usually conducted by staff from both the agricultural and health sectors and often with WHO support. This activity is now being intensified.   The challenges in North Sumatra are, however, great. The village is in an isolated mountainous area. Residents have been traumatized by the sudden deaths and mystified by the appearance of this disease despite the apparent health of poultry and other livestock. Bereaved family members have shown some reluctance to collaborate with authorities and many questions remain unanswered. Distrust of the authorities, investigators, and the diagnosis is widespread. Given the high mortality, hospitalization is associated with a fatal outcome. The most recently confirmed case refused hospital admission throughout most of his illness. He died this morning en route to a hospital.  "

Six of the cases were fatal.   One fatal case, in a 38-year-old woman, occurred in the city of Surabaya, in East Java. She developed symptoms on 2 May, was hospitalized on 7 May, and died on 12 May. The case is the first reported from this area.   The remaining six cases are from the village of Kubu Sembelang in the Karo district of North Sumatra. All six are members of an extended family, and all but one lived in neighbouring houses.   Associated with the Kubu Sembelang outbreak is a seventh family member, a 37-year-old woman. She developed symptoms on 27 April and died of respiratory disease on 4 May. No specimens were obtained before her burial, and the cause of her death cannot be confirmed. She is, however, considered the initial case in this family cluster.   The six confirmed cases in Sumatra include the woman’s two sons, aged 15 and 17 years, who died respectively on 9 May and 12 May. The 28-year-old sister of the initial case died on 10 May. This sister had an 18-month-old girl, who died on 14 May. The fifth confirmed case, who is still alive, is the 25-year-old brother of the initial case. The sixth confirmed case is the 10-year-old nephew of the initial case. He died on 13 May.   One additional family member, who had been hospitalized, has subsequently been ruled out based on both negative laboratory results and the absence of clinical symptoms compatible with H5N1 infection.   This is the largest cluster of cases, closely related in time and place, reported to date in any country and is being carefully investigated by Indonesia’s ministries of health and agriculture and by WHO epidemiologists. The source of exposure for the initial case is still under investigation, with exposure to infected poultry or an environment contaminated by their faeces considered the most plausible source.   The likely source of infection for the additional cases has not yet been determined. Multiple hypotheses are being investigated. Apart from living in close proximity to each other, the cases in this cluster are known to have participated in a family gathering around 29 April. The cases may have acquired their infection from a shared environmental exposure yet to be identified. The possibility of limited human-to-human transmission cannot be ruled out at present.   Investigators at the outbreak site have found no evidence that infection has spread beyond members of this single extended family. No influenza-like illness has been identified in health care workers or other persons in close contact with the patients. If human-to-human transmission has occurred, it has not been either efficient or sustained.   The newly confirmed cases bring the total in Indonesia to 40. Of these cases, 31 have been fatal.  "

Health authorities in Djibouti initiated surveillance for human cases following reports of a small number of chicken deaths in early April. NAMRU-3 has also confirmed the presence of H5N1 virus in samples from three chickens.   Surveillance for additional human and animal cases is presently under way, but is hindered by the country’s lack of resources and of epidemiological and laboratory capacities. The search for human cases has been further complicated by a concurrent outbreak of dengue fever, which can mask the occurrence of other febrile illnesses with abrupt onset of symptoms, including H5N1 infection.   The situation in animals is poorly understood. Most of the country’s population is concentrated in the Djibouti district, where many households keep small numbers of poultry. Poultry production in other parts of the country is limited. High mortality in poultry flocks has not been detected to date.

The case, which was fatal, occurred in a 3-year-old girl from Kampong Speu Province, west of Phnom Penh in the southern part of the country.   The child developed fever on 14 March. Her condition deteriorated rapidly and she was hospitalized in Phnom Penh on 20 March. She died on 21 March. Samples from the girl tested positive for H5N1 infection at the Pasteur Institute in Cambodia.   A team of officials from the Ministry of Health and WHO have investigated the situation in the remote village where the child lived. Backyard poultry began dying in the village in February, and chicken deaths have continued. The child is known to have played with chickens, including some showing signs of illness.   The investigation found seven residents with fever but no respiratory symptoms. All had a history of recent contact with diseased birds or had been involved in caring for the child. Although none of these people presently shows symptoms compatible with H5N1 infection, all have been placed under medical observation as a precaution. Samples have been taken from these people and other close contacts of the child. Test results are expected next week.   The Ministry of Agriculture has taken samples from chickens in the area. Testing is under way.   This is the fifth confirmed case in Cambodia and the first in almost a year. The four previous cases, all from the adjacent Kampot Province which borders Viet Nam, and all fatal, occurred from end-January 2005 through mid-April 2005.  "

Although antitoxin for the treatment of botulism is only available in some countries, WHO was able to ensure delivery of antitoxin to Thailand by the morning of 19 March.   As of 20 March, the Ministry of Public Health (MOPH) established that 152 of the 170 people attending a local village Buddhist festival in Banluang District, Nan Province, had developed symptoms suggestive of botulism (dysphagia, dysarthria, ptosis, abdominal discomfort, muscle weakness). All of the affected people had eaten pickled bamboo shoots prepared in a traditional manner, with symptoms developing and progressing over 24-48 hours following consumption. One hundred of the 152 people were hospitalized, and 40 have since required intubation and respirator support. To date, no deaths have been reported.   The local health office has traced and recalled the suspect cans of locally produced bamboo shoots and is providing public education on food safety. WHO is working closely with the MOPH, local technical partners and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) on laboratory investigation in support of case diagnosis, investigation, and foodborne disease investigation and surveillance. A case control and cohort study is under way to describe the outbreak in detail.   To date, 80 doses of antitoxin (20 from the United Kingdom, 50 from CDC Atlanta and 10 from Sanofi-Pasteur Canada) have been provided, and severely affected patients are being treated.

Positive H5N1 results were obtained for seven of these patients. Five cases were fatal.   Today is an official holiday in Azerbaijan. The government will issue an official statement on the situation shortly.   Six of the cases occurred in Salyan Rayon in the south-eastern part of the country. All six cases resided in the small Daikyand settlement of around 800 homes.   A 17-year-old girl died on 23 February. Her first cousin, a 20-year-old woman, died on 3 March. The 16-year-old brother of this woman died on 10 March. A 17-year-old girl, a close friend of the family, died on 8 March. All four of these cases lived together or near each other. The source of their infection is presently under investigation.   The additional two cases in Salyan involve a 10-year-old boy, who has recovered, and a 15-year-old girl, who is hospitalized in critical condition.   The seventh case occurred in a 21-year-old woman from the western rayon of Tarter. She died on 9 March.   Two additional patients, from Salyan and the adjacent rayon of Neftchela, have been hospitalized with symptoms of bilateral pneumonia. Testing of these patients is presently under way.   Last week, WHO strengthened its field team in Azerbaijan to include experts in clinical management and infection control and additional senior epidemiologists.   Over the weekend, a field investigation in Salyan, jointly conducted by WHO and the Azeri Ministry of Health, found some evidence that carcasses of numerous swans, dead for some weeks but not buried, may have been collected by residents as a source of feathers. In this community, the defeathering of birds is a task usually undertaken by adolescent girls and young women. The WHO team is today investigating whether this practice may have been the source of infection in Daikyand, where the majority of cases have occurred in females between the ages of 15 and 20 years. Interviews with surviving family members have failed to uncover a history of direct exposure to dead or diseased poultry for several of the cases.   Excellent collaboration between the Ministry of Health and the WHO team continues. WHO is confident that ongoing house-to-house surveillance for cases of influenza-like illness, undertaken by more than 90 local medical teams in Salyan and Tarter, will detect patients requiring further investigation. On-site diagnostic capacity continues to be provided by the US Naval Medical Research Unit 3 (NAMRU-3). A better understanding of the situation in animals is, however, urgently needed.  "

Estimations from a mathematical model evaluate that 204 000 people may have been infected by chikungunya virus since March 2005 on La Réunion, including 13 000 persons during the week 27 February - 5 March 2006. Between 1 January 2006 - 5 March 2006, 25 patients with clinical symptoms consistent with dengue fever were laboratory confirmed. Five were isolated cases and 20 were suspected cases of co-infection chikungunya-dengue.   Since the beginning of January 2006, other countries in the south west Indian Ocean have reported chikungunya cases: Mayotte (9 January - 10 March, 2833 suspected cases), Mauritius (1 January - 5 March c. 6000 suspected cases including 1200 confirmed cases), and the Seychelles (1 January - 26 February, 8818 suspected cases).   Several European countries have reported imported cases in people returning from these islands: France (160 imported cases), Germany, Italy, Norway and Switzerland.   A mixed outbreak of chikungunya, with sporadic cases of dengue has been reported in Andhra Pradesh state, India. Between 1 December 2005 - 17 February 2006, 5671 cases of fever with arthralgia were reported. High density of Aedes aegypti was observed in the area. From 1-15 March, over 2000 cases of chikungunya have been reported from Malegaon town in Nasik district, Maharashtra state, India. In Orissa state, India, 4904 cases of fever associated with myalgia and headache have been reported between 27 February - 5 March 2006. These signs are consistent with an arbovirus outbreak. Results of a biological investigation are awaited.   Dengue in Madagascar and Maldives   Madagascar has reported a dengue outbreak in the port city of Toamasina. The outbreak started mid-January 2006. Sporadic cases of chikungunya have been reported since mid-February.   Maldives has experienced an outbreak of dengue since January 2006, with 602 suspected cases until 5 March 2006 (including 64 cases of dengue haemorrhagic fever and 9 cases of dengue shock syndrome).   Chikungunya and dengue viruses are transmitted to humans by the bites of infected mosquitoes. On La Réunion, Mauritius, the Seychelles and the east coast of Madagascar, Aedes aegypti is absent or scarce in the vicinity of houses. In contrast, Ae. albopictus is abundant and may be the only important vector of these viruses on the islands. In the Maldives Ae. aegypti is the presumed vector. Both species bite mainly during the daytime, particularly in the early hours after dawn and for 2-3 hours before darkness. Aedes albopictus is more active outdoors whereas Ae. aegypti typically feeds and rests more indoors.   Mosquito control is the main outbreak control activity. Close to habitation, these two mosquito species multiply in collections of stagnant water, mostly in artificial containers. To control the mosquitoes, their breeding sites must be removed, destroyed, protected, frequently emptied and cleaned, or treated with insecticides. During epidemics, insecticides are also often applied as space sprays to kill the adult mosquitoes.   Such measures require the mobilization of affected communities to carry out critical, well-identified healthy behaviours. The Communications for Behavioural Impact (COMBI) approach is a powerful strategy to support this mobilization process both in individuals and communities.   Control measures   A WHO team from the Regional Office for Africa and from headquarters was deployed to the south west Indian Ocean in February-March 2006 to assess the control measures under way in the islands and to discuss a sub-regional coordinated strategy for surveillance and control of arboviruses in the area with national authorities. ( see previous report ). Additional expertise in the COMBI approach has been sent to Madagascar and Mauritius for follow-up. Similarly, Maldives has received support for their social mobilization activities on dengue vector control.   In India, a multidisciplinary national team was deployed from 13 -17 February 2006 to assist local health authorities in improving public health measures including strengthening of arbovirus surveillance, clinical management of cases, vector control and social mobilization.   Although transmission of chikungunya and dengue is continuing in the affected areas, WHO recommends no special restrictions on travel or trade to or from these areas. However, it is recommended that individuals take precautions to protect themselves from mosquito bites, e.g., by wearing clothes that minimize skin exposure and applying insect repellents to exposed skin or clothing in accordance with label instructions.

WHO will adjust the figures in its cumulative table of confirmed cases following the results of this external verification. Test results from the UK are expected later this week.   H5N1 is the only strain within the H5 subtype known to cause human infections. It is highly likely that the H5N1 strain will be detected in further tests.   Two of the cases were from the south-eastern rayon of Salyan, but resided in different settlements. The cases occurred in a 17-year-old girl, from Sarvan settlement, who died on 23 February, and a 20-year-old woman, from Daikyand settlement, who died on 3 March. Poultry deaths have been observed in the settlements in recent weeks, but the cause of death has not yet been determined.

All of these persons are from the Daikyand settlement in Salyan Rayon in the eastern part of the country.   The Salyan Rayon is located near wetlands frequented by migratory birds. Recent deaths of poultry have been reported in the Daikyand settlement, but the cause of these deaths has not yet been determined. The investigation was launched when two young women, who were neighbours, died within a week of each other. The first patient, a 17-year-old girl, died on 23 February. She was reported to have suffered for more than a year from respiratory symptoms associated with a neoplastic condition. Her death is now thought to have been caused by this pre-existing disease. As a precaution, samples have been taken and will be sent for H5N1 testing at a WHO collaborating laboratory in the United Kingdom.   The second death occurred on 3 March in a 20-year-old woman who died following rapidly progressive acute pneumonia, which is a characteristic feature in many cases of H5N1 infection.   Immediately following the second death, the Ministry of Health initiated daily house-to-house investigations, conducted by four teams of hospital staff, looking for persons in the settlement having respiratory symptoms or fever. As a result, an additional 8 persons were hospitalized for observation. Of these, six showed only mild symptoms. They have fully recovered and have now been discharged from hospital.   Of the remaining two patients, one, a 17-year-old girl, died on 8 March. A 16-year-old boy remains hospitalized in isolation. His condition is critical.   The response of the Ministry of Health has been prompt and efficient, but hampered by the lack of some essential equipment and supplies and inadequate diagnostic capacity. Prior to the event, staff from the Ministry of Health had visited offices of sanitary hygiene and epidemiology in each rayon within the country, creating a high level of awareness of the disease and a correspondingly high level of alert for possible cases of unusual respiratory disease. The house-to-house surveillance for cases is continuing.   A WHO team is presently in Azerbaijan to assess needs and provide technical support to health officials. The team will be augmented on Monday with additional expertise and supplies, including laboratory equipment and diagnostic reagents. Samples have been collected by local officials and shipment to the WHO-affiliated laboratory is expected to take place early next week. Supplies of the antiviral drug oseltamivir are available in Azerbaijan, but the quantity is limited. To date, all patients under investigation have received treatment with this drug.   Highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza was initially confirmed in Azerbaijan on 9 February in wild birds found in the coastal area near the capital city of Baku. On 24 February, the country announced detection of infection in poultry at farms in Khyzy (in the north-eastern part of the country) and Bilasuvar (near Salyan).

"2006","http://www.who.int/csr/don/2006_03_09a/en/index.html"," Avian influenza – H5N1 infection found in a stone marten in Germany   9 March 2006   Officials in Germany have today confirmed H5N1 infection in a second mammalian species, the stone marten. This finding marks the first documented infection of this species with an avian influenza virus. Previously, H5N1 infection was confirmed in Germany in three domestic cats.   The marten was found alive, but showing signs of severe illness, on the Baltic island of Ruegen on 2 March. The animal was euthanized. Tests conducted at Germany’s Friedrich-Loeffler-Institut for Animal Health confirmed infection with the H5N1 avian influenza virus.   The ill animal was found in the same heavily affected area of the island, near Schaprode, as three dead domestic cats. Tests conducted at the Friedrich-Loeffler-Institut subsequently confirmed that all three cats were infected with the highly pathogenic H5N1 virus. The stone marten is a predatory nocturnal mammal with feeding habits similar to those of domestic cats. As with the cats found on Ruegen island, the marten is presumed to have acquired its infection after feeding on an infected bird.   Since 16 February, German authorities have confirmed H5N1 infection in 125 wild swans, ducks, geese, and birds of prey on Ruegen Island, pointing to considerable opportunities for exposures to occur in small mammals that feed on birds.   As is the case with humans, infections in animal species other than birds are rare events. To date, only domestic poultry are known to have played a role in the transmission cycle of the virus from animals to humans.   In July 2005, tests on three rare Owston’s palm civets that died in captivity in Viet Nam detected H5N1 infection, marking the first known infection in this mammalian species. Large cats, including tigers and leopards, kept in capacity and fed on infected poultry carcasses, have also been infected and developed severe disease. Ferrets are another mammalian species known to be susceptible to infection.   Further investigation is needed to determine whether evidence of H5N1 infection in new mammalian species has any significance for the risk of human infection or the potential of this virus to adapt to mammals, including humans.

To date, outbreaks have been detected on more than 130 farms in 11 of the country’s 37 states.   By the end of February, local laboratory tests had detected the virus in 7 contiguous states in the northern and central parts of the country (Kaduna, Kano, Plateau, Katsina, Bauchi, Yobe, and Nasarawa) and in the Federal Capital Territory of Abuja. During the first week of March, the virus was detected in three additional states, Anambra, Benue, and Rivers, located in the southern part of the country.   Control measures on farms have included culling, disinfection, and safe disposal of carcasses. Altogether, some 450,000 birds have either died or been destroyed since the start of the outbreak in early January.   This week, the federal government officially launched its scheme for compensating farmers for lost birds. Payment has been made to farmers, initially in the state of Kano.   Diagnostic capacity for testing animal and human samples within the country has now been strengthened with support from WHO and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. More than 60 samples taken from patients under investigation have now been tested. All results to date are negative for H5N1 infection.   In neighbouring Niger, where the virus was confirmed in poultry on 27 February, a WHO team has been deployed to assist authorities in their assessment of the situation. Additional suspected outbreaks in poultry have been reported in the initially affected Magaria area. As in Nigeria, no human cases have been reported to date in Niger.   Staff at the WHO office in Nigeria have emphasized the demands a disease of this nature places on resources and capacities in a newly affected country, especially when late detection and delayed introduction of control measures allow the virus to spread widely. While an intense initial emergency response can be mounted, with external support, it is extremely challenging for any country in sub-Saharan Africa to sustain an adequate response beyond a few months.   In parts of Asia, where the current poultry outbreaks began in mid-2003, experience has demonstrated the difficulty of eliminating the virus once it has become widely present in birds. This experience has also shown that continuing circulation of the virus in birds carries a continuing risk of sporadic human cases. Most human cases have occurred in rural or peri-urban areas where households keep small backyard flocks, allowing close and continuing human exposure to virus from infected birds.   Continuing vigilance for human cases in Nigeria is essential. Virus isolated from poultry in Nigeria is genetically almost identical to viruses that recently caused fatal human cases in Turkey and Iraq.  "

"2006","http://www.who.int/csr/don/2006_02_28a/en/index.html"," H5N1 avian influenza in domestic cats   28 February 2006   Authorities in Germany have today announced detection of H5N1 avian influenza in a domestic cat. The cat was found dead over the weekend on the northern island of Ruegen. Since mid-February, more than 100 wild birds have died on the island, and tests have confirmed H5N1 infection in several.   There is no present evidence that domestic cats play a role in the transmission cycle of H5N1 viruses. To date, no human case has been linked to exposure to a diseased cat. No outbreaks in domestic cats have been reported.   Unlike the case in domestic and wild birds, there is no evidence that domestic cats are a reservoir of the virus. All available evidence indicates that cat infections occur in association with H5N1 outbreaks in domestic or wild birds.   Experimental studies, published in September 2004, demonstrated that the H5N1 virus can infect domestic cats, and that cats can transmit the virus to other cats. In these experiments, the cats developed disease following direct inoculation of virus isolated from a fatal human case, and following the feeding of infected raw chicken.   The current H5N1 panzootic in birds, which began in mid-2003 in parts of South-East Asia, has been accompanied by a few anecdotal reports of H5N1 infection in domestic cats. In all such reports, eating raw infected poultry was considered the most likely source of infection for the cats.   Several published studies have demonstrated H5N1 infection in large cats kept in captivity. In December 2003, two tigers and two leopards, fed on fresh chicken carcasses, died unexpectedly at a zoo in Thailand. Subsequent investigation identified H5N1 in tissue samples.   In February 2004, the virus was detected in a clouded leopard that died at a zoo near Bangkok. A white tiger died from infection with the virus at the same zoo in March 2004.   In October 2004, captive tigers fed on fresh chicken carcasses began dying in large numbers at a zoo in Thailand. Altogether 147 tigers out of 441 died of infection or were euthanized. Subsequent investigation determined that at least some tiger-to-tiger transmission of the virus occurred.  "
"2006","http://www.who.int/csr/don/2006_02_28/en/index.html"," Avian influenza – situation (poultry) in Niger   28 February 2006   Highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza has been confirmed in poultry in Niger, marking spread of the virus to a second country in sub-Saharan Africa.   During February, significant mortality of chickens and ducks was observed in five outbreaks in two administrative districts near the border with Nigeria. Positive test results were reported yesterday on samples taken from dead ducks in Magaria and Dan Barde, located in one of the two districts. Investigation of the additional outbreaks is under way. Staff at the WHO country office in Niger reported today that no human cases are presently under investigation for possible H5N1 infection.   In neighbouring Nigeria, an outbreak in the northern part of the country was officially confirmed on 8 February, but is now known to have begun almost a month earlier. Detection of the virus in Niger confirms fears that conditions in West Africa, including late detection of outbreaks, the fluid movement of birds across borders, and low population awareness of the disease, will favour spread to additional countries.   Experience in all affected countries has shown how easily and rapidly the virus can become established in birds when detection is late and the introduction of control measures is delayed.   In Nigeria’s northern province of Kano, near the border with Niger, some 51 farms are now known to have been affected. In that country, four persons have been investigated to date for possible H5N1 infection. Local tests have ruled out infection in three of these cases, including one which was fatal.   Outbreaks in numerous other African countries are currently under investigation. Throughout most of Africa, rapid detection and investigation of outbreaks are hampered by the absence of an early warning system for avian influenza in animals or humans, inadequate diagnostic capacity, and difficulties in shipping specimens, both internally and abroad, for diagnostic confirmation.   Concern that human cases may occur in affected parts of Africa is high, given the close contact between people and poultry. Laboratory studies have shown that the virus presently circulating in Nigeria is virtually identical to viruses that have caused human cases and deaths elsewhere since the start of this year.   The continent has an estimated 1.1 billion chickens, mostly produced in backyard farming systems. Traditional practices, exacerbated by rural poverty, favour the home slaughter and consumption of birds when signs of illness appear in a flock. These behaviours carry a high risk of human exposures and infections. While most countries in Africa have a veterinary infrastructure that serves commercial farms, few have services extending to rural areas.   WHO is concerned that spread of the virus to additional parts of Africa will broaden opportunities for human cases to occur under circumstances where capacities to find, diagnose, investigate, and manage cases are limited. Each additional human case gives the virus an opportunity to evolve towards a form that spreads easily from person to person.  "

No human cases have been detected to date.   Nigerian officials have confirmed outbreaks at commercial farms in the states of Kano, Plateau, Katsina, and Bauchi, and in the Abuja area. Outbreaks have also been detected at more farms in Kaduna. Outbreaks in additional states are currently under investigation.   To date, four patients with respiratory symptoms and a history of exposure to diseased poultry have been investigated for possible infection. This number includes a woman who died of an acute respiratory illness on 16 February. The three remaining patients are all in good condition.   Arrangements are being made to send samples from all four patients for testing at a WHO collaborating laboratory in the United Kingdom.   The initial outbreak in Kaduna state is now known to have begun on 10 January, raising the possibility that earlier human exposures and cases may have occurred in that area and elsewhere. At hospitals in Kaduna, Kano, and Katsina near affected farms, staff from the WHO-led teams have now examined hundreds of patient records, searching for possible cases that may have occurred earlier. No such cases have been identified to date.   The scale of the outbreak in birds is not yet fully understood. Most investigations have followed poultry deaths on large commercial farms, where outbreaks are highly visible. Little is known about the presence of the virus in small backyard flocks, where the greatest risk of human exposures and infections resides.   Nigeria has an estimated poultry population of around 140 million birds, largely concentrated in the south-western part of the country. As is the case in several affected parts of South-east Asia, around 60% of Nigeria’s poultry production takes place in small backyard flocks. Large-scale commercial farming of poultry occurs mainly in the northern states, where outbreaks have been confirmed.   Rapid spread of the virus within Nigeria has raised concern over possible spread to neighbouring countries. Borders are porous and restrictions on the movement of people and poultry are difficult to enforce. WHO staff at offices in these countries are monitoring the situation closely in collaboration with government officials. Rumours of possible human cases in neighbouring countries are also being closely monitored.  "

India is one of 13 countries that have reported their first cases of H5N1 infection in birds since the beginning of February. (The 13 countries, listed in order of reporting, are Iraq, Nigeria, Azerbaijan, Bulgaria, Greece, Italy, Slovenia, Iran, Austria, Germany, Egypt, India and France.)   On 20 February, Malaysia reported a fresh outbreak in poultry after having been considered free of the disease for more than a year.   The situation in these recently affected countries varies greatly. Most European countries with good veterinary surveillance have detected the virus in a small number of wild birds only, with no evidence to date of spread to domestic birds.   In Azerbaijan, detection of the virus has coincided with die-offs of domestic birds. In Egypt, outbreaks in domestic poultry have now been confirmed in 10 governorates; deaths have also been reported in exotic zoo birds. In Iraq, presence of the virus in birds was found only after the country confirmed its first human case.   In Nigeria, as in India, the first cases were detected in large commercial farms, where the disease is highly visible and outbreaks are difficult to miss.   Apart from Iraq, none of the countries newly affected during February has reported human cases. Iraq has reported two human cases, both of which were fatal; samples from several other patients are currently undergoing tests.   For human health, experience elsewhere over the past two years has shown that the greatest risk of cases arises when the virus becomes established in small backyard flocks, which allow continuing opportunities for close human contact, exposures, and infections to occur.   All available evidence indicates that the virus does not spread easily from poultry to humans. To date, very few cases have been detected in poultry workers, cullers, or veterinarians. Almost all cases have been linked to close contact to diseased household flocks, often during slaughtering, defeathering, butchering, and preparation of poultry for consumption.   No cases have been linked to the consumption of properly cooked poultry meat or eggs, even in households where disease was known to be present in flocks.  "

Experience in several other countries has shown how quickly the H5N1 virus can spread and become firmly established in poultry. The ability of this virus to cause rare but severe disease in humans is well documented.   At present, the only confirmed H5N1 outbreak is thought to be confined to a large commercial farm, located in Kaduna State in the northern part of the country, where thousands of chickens were kept in battery cages. Investigations are urgently needed to determine whether the outbreak, which began almost a month ago, has spread from the farm to affect household flocks. Poultry deaths in the adjacent province of Kano have been reported, but the cause has not yet been determined.   The most immediate public health need is to reduce opportunities for human infections to occur. Investigations of human cases in Asia and elsewhere have identified close contact with diseased or dead household poultry as the most important source of human exposure to the virus.   In Nigeria, as in other parts of Africa, most village households maintain free-ranging flocks of poultry as a source of income and food. Close human contact with poultry is extensive.   If the virus has spread to household flocks in Nigeria, public information campaigns will be needed to warn populations to avoid high-risk behaviours, including the slaughtering, defeathering, butchering, and preparation for consumption of diseased poultry.   WHO is ready to respond to requests from Nigeria for support, including assessment teams and the provision of essential supplies and equipment. Infectious disease staff at WHO’s regional office in Harare, Zimbabwe held an emergency meeting today to assess the situation, plan a response, and evaluate the possible risk to other African countries. A team of experts experienced in the investigation of outbreaks has been placed on standby.   No clear information about the source of the Nigerian outbreak is presently available, but the country is known to lie along a flight route for birds migrating from central Asia.   Full sequence information about the virus in the Nigerian outbreak is expected later this week. This information will allow comparison with viruses that have caused human cases elsewhere and thus assist in the assessment of risks to human health. Sequence information may also shed some light on the origins of the outbreak.  "

Confirmed outbreaks of highly pathogenic H5N1 in poultry were reported in the area on 2 February.   The team has met with officials in the country’s ministries of health and agriculture and is now assessing the situation in hospitals, laboratories, and animals. A list of immediate needs for support has been established.   Government officials have expressed a need for emergency supplies and equipment, including antiviral drugs, and these have already begun to arrive in the country. A 24-hour emergency operations centre has been set up in the WHO regional office in Cairo to facilitate coordination and provide back-up support.   The transportation of patient samples for diagnostic confirmation has encountered difficulties. Ways to strengthen local testing capacity are being explored together with ways to expedite the shipment of samples to WHO reference laboratories. The team has noted a need to upgrade biosafety standards in local and national laboratories.   Intensive culling of poultry is under way in the area; improved diagnostic capacity for poultry is needed to focus these efforts better. Training to enhance the diagnostic capacity of veterinary laboratories and improve surveillance has already begun. Requests for essential supplies, including diagnostic reagents, are being met.   The area has around 1.3 million poultry mainly raised by individual households, who depend on these animals for income and food. Discussions are under way to develop a compensation scheme that could lessen the hardship on these families.   The team found a good system in place for detecting and managing possible human cases, collecting specimens, and tracing and monitoring contacts. Some improvements in isolation wards are planned. Intensive training courses are being organized for hospital staff to ensure that proper measures for personal protection and infection control are in place.   Two patients hospitalized for observation have been discharged, though their condition continues to be monitored by local health teams. At present, 7 patients are being treated, in isolation, at hospitals in the area. Most of these patients have reported a history of direct contact with diseased poultry.   In addition to the confirmed fatal case, two patients under investigation for possible H5N1 infection have died. Specimens from one of these, the 39-year-old uncle of the confirmed case, have tested positive for H5N1 infection in a local laboratory; his infection has not yet been confirmed by a WHO reference laboratory.   A possible H5N1 case in the southern part of the country has been officially reported to WHO by the Ministry of Health. The case, a 13-year-old boy from the Omara area, developed symptoms on 1 February, was hospitalized with severe pneumonia on 5 February, and died the same day. Although no poultry deaths have been reported in the area, pet birds kept by the family are said to have died near the time of symptom onset.   Samples from the boy have been taken. The Minister of Health and a team from the country’s Centre for Disease Control will visit the Omara area tomorrow to investigate.  "

Two of these cases were fatal.   The first fatal case was a 22-year-old man from West Java who died on 26 January. He worked as a banana vendor at a market in East Jakarta where poultry meat was sold. Neighbours near his home reported poultry deaths prior to his onset of symptoms.   The second fatal case was a 15-year-old boy from West Java who died on 1 February. Deaths in chickens near his home were reported in the week prior to symptom onset.   The third case is a nine-year old girl from West Java who was hospitalized on 19 January and has since recovered. She lived in a village neighbouring that of the two fatal cases in siblings confirmed on 23 January. Investigation of those cases resulted in the girl’s prompt hospitalization and treatment. She has now fully recovered. Poultry deaths were reported in her village prior to symptom onset.   The fourth case is a five-year-old boy from Lampung Province who developed symptoms in October of last year and has since fully recovered. The child is the brother of a previously confirmed case, a 20-year-old man who developed symptoms in late September and likewise fully recovered. Both the child and his brother had direct exposure to diseased chickens during slaughtering. As initial diagnostic tests produced inconclusive results, retrospective confirmation of the child’s infection relied on antibody levels in acute blood samples taken during his illness and convalescent samples taken following recovery.   All three cases with recent symptom onset resided in West Java, where a resurgence of virus activity in birds has been reported.   The newly confirmed cases bring the total in Indonesia to 23. Of these cases, 16 were fatal.  "

The case was a 15-year-old girl from the northern part of the country who died of severe respiratory disease on 17 January. Test results have now confirmed her infection.   Specimens from the girl’s 39-year-old uncle, who died on 27 January, and a 54-year-old woman under treatment for respiratory illness are being sent to the UK laboratory but have not yet arrived.   A joint WHO/FAO/OIE team of international experts has been despatched to Iraq at the request of the Ministry of Health. The initial small team of epidemiologists and experts on animal disease will conduct a rapid assessment of the situation in the Sulaimaniyah area of northern Iraq. Because of the security situation, the team is not expected to arrive in the area until early next week.   At present, an additional two people, showing symptoms suggestive of H5N1 infection, have been hospitalized for treatment in the Sulaimaniyah area. Health officials, with support from WHO staff, have set up an emergency operations room to respond to the outbreak, investigate rumours, and address public concerns.   Rumours of possible human cases in other parts of the country have been systematically followed up. To date, no such rumours have been substantiated.   The detection of the country’s first human case occurred despite the absence of confirmed outbreaks of the disease in poultry.  Detection of the case indicates a high level of awareness of the clinical features of this disease and good vigilance on the part of clinicians. It also points to an urgent need to investigate the extent of bird outbreaks in northern Iraq and possibly elsewhere. Team members with veterinary expertise will assess animal health issues and support the government in its efforts to control the spread of the disease in poultry.   Experiences with poultry outbreaks of highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza in other countries have shown how quickly this virus can establish itself in poultry populations and spread widely when detection and control measures are delayed. Poultry culling is under way in northern Iraq and large numbers of birds have already been destroyed.   WHO-led teams are currently conducting or completing field assessments in nine countries in the area: Armenia, Azerbaijan, Egypt, Georgia, Iran, Lebanon, Moldova, Syria, and Ukraine.    "

Samples from the remaining 9 patients, confirmed as H5 positive in the Ankara laboratory, are undergoing further joint investigation by the Ankara and UK laboratories.   Testing for H5N1 infection is technically challenging, particularly under the conditions of an outbreak where large numbers of samples are submitted for testing and rapid results are needed to guide clinical decisions. Additional testing in a WHO collaborating laboratory may produce inconclusive or only weakly positive results. In such cases, clinical data about the patient are used to make a final assessment.  "

The case occurred in a 15-year-old girl who died on 17 January following a severe respiratory illness. Her symptoms were compatible with a diagnosis of H5N1 avian influenza.   Preliminary laboratory confirmation was provided by a US Naval Medical Research Unit located in Cairo, Egypt.   The girl’s 39-year-old uncle, who cared for her during her illness, developed symptoms on 24 January and died of a severe respiratory disease on 27 January.   Both patients resided in the town of Raniya near Sulaimaniyah in the northern part of the country, close to the border with Turkey. Poultry deaths were recently reported in their neighbourhood, but H5N1 avian influenza has not yet been confirmed in birds in any part of the country. Poultry samples have been sent for testing at an external laboratory.   A history of exposure to diseased birds has been found for the girl. The uncle’s source of infection is under investigation.

The case occurred in a 29-year-old woman from Chengdu City in the south-central province of Sichuan. She developed fever on 12 January and was hospitalized with symptoms of pneumonia. Authorities say her condition deteriorated rapidly, and she died on 23 January.   Information provided to WHO indicates that she was self-employed in a shop selling dry goods. No information on possible exposure to diseased birds as the source of her infection is presently available, but an investigation is under way. Close contacts have been placed under medical observation.   This is the second human case reported this year in China, both from Sichuan Province. The two Sichuan cases occurred in different prefectures located around 150 km apart. A confirmed outbreak of H5N1 in poultry began in late December in another part of the province. No outbreaks have been confirmed in the areas where the two human cases resided.   During 2005, Chinese agricultural authorities reported 32 outbreaks in poultry in 12 provinces, resulting in the culling of more than 24 million birds. The appearance of human cases in areas without reported poultry outbreaks is a cause for concern. WHO recommends that, in China, testing for possible H5N1 infection should be undertaken in all cases of severe respiratory disease having no alternative diagnosis, even when no poultry outbreak has been reported in the patient’s area of residence.   Of the ten cases confirmed in China, seven have been fatal. The cases have occurred in 7 provinces and regions: Anhui, Guangxi, Liaoning, Jiangxi, Fujian, Hunan, and Sichuan.

The case is a 4-year-old boy from the district of Dogubayazit in Agri Province in the eastern part of the country. An outbreak in poultry began in the district in December 2005. The child developed symptoms on 5 January and was hospitalized on 13 January. He is being treated at a hospital in Erzurum Province.   Like the two cases confirmed on 16 January, also from Dogubayazit, exposure in this case occurred prior to the government’s launch of an intensive public education campaign. Rapid surveys conducted in the most severely affected eastern part of the country have found an almost universal awareness of the disease and of the risk factors for infection. This awareness has been accompanied by behavioural changes that are expected to reduce opportunities for human infections to occur.   As the virus is now known to be present in birds in many parts of the country, some additional human cases should be anticipated in the immediate future. The number of these cases is, however, expected to decline as high-risk behaviours become less common and culling operations, which are presently under way, reduce the number of infected birds.   The newly confirmed case brings the total in Turkey to 21. Of these cases, four were fatal. All four were residents of Dogubayazit.   A second shipment of laboratory specimens arrived yesterday at a WHO collaborating laboratory in the United Kingdom. Apart from providing diagnostic confirmation, the laboratory will undertake viral characterization and genetic and antigenic analyses of viruses.

The patients are residents of Sanliurfa Province, near the southern border with Syria, and Siirt Province, which is adjacent to Van in the eastern part of the country. Human cases have now been reported from nine of the country’s 81 provinces.   Both patients are young children, aged four and six years, and both have a documented history of direct contact with diseased birds. In Sanliurfa Province, outbreaks in backyard poultry are now thought to date back to late November 2005. Altogether, agricultural officials have confirmed poultry outbreaks in 11 provinces and are investigating possible outbreaks in an additional 14 provinces across the country.   Laboratory tests completed today in Turkey have detected the H5 virus subtype in post-mortem specimens taken from a 12-year-old girl, from Agri Province, who died 7 January. The child was the sibling of two other patients who died earlier. Their infection with the H5N1 virus was subsequently confirmed by a WHO collaborating laboratory in the United Kingdom.   The Ministry of Health is now reporting 18 laboratory-confirmed cases, of which three, all from the same family, have been fatal.   Arrangements have been made to send specimens from several patients to the UK collaborating laboratory for further analysis. Due to official holidays in Turkey, specimens are not expected to arrive in the UK before Monday. The head of the collaborating laboratory is now in Ankara to support diagnostic work at the country’s national influenza centre. Ways are being sought to expedite the testing of patient samples. High awareness of the disease in the Turkish population, combined with almost daily reports of poultry outbreaks in new areas, has resulted in a large number of people concerned about exposure and seeking reassurance.   The rapid assessment of patients with a possible exposure history is providing a unique opportunity to learn more about the disease in humans. It is also generating data that can be used to assess the efficacy of antiviral drugs, as most people with an exposure history or respiratory symptoms are receiving oseltamivir either prophylactically or very early after the onset of symptoms.   Members of the international teams, in Van Province and Ankara, are today working with local experts to plan relevant studies. These studies should deepen understanding of the epidemiology of the disease, including the possibility that any human-to-human transmission may have occurred, the vulnerability to infection of health care workers and other occupationally-exposed groups, and the possibility that milder forms of the disease might be occurring in the general population.   All available evidence indicates that no sustained human-to-human transmission has occurred. As in Asia, contact with infected birds is the principal source of infection. The risk of infection for travellers to Turkey is negligible provided direct contact with dead or diseased domestic and wild birds is avoided.  Gene sequencing information on human viruses   The WHO Collaborating Centre for Reference and Research on influenza at the MRC National Institute for Medical Research in Mill Hill, London, has today completed genetic and antigenic analyses of viruses recovered from the first two fatal human cases in the Turkish outbreak.   Information provided to WHO indicates that these viruses are very similar to current avian H5N1 viruses isolated from birds in Turkey. They are also closely related to viruses isolated from the large outbreak in migratory birds that occurred at the Qinghai Lake nature reserve in China, beginning in late April of last year.   These analyses indicate that the Turkish viruses are sensitive to both classes of antiviral drugs, including oseltamivir and amantadine. WHO and collaborating experts will review the data on amantadine sensitivity. Oseltamivir remains the drug of first choice recommended by WHO.   Virus from one of the patients shows mutations at the receptor-binding site. One of the mutations has been seen previously in viruses isolated from a small outbreak in Hong Kong in 2003 (two cases, one of which was fatal) and from the 2005 outbreak in Viet Nam. Research has indicated that the Hong Kong 2003 viruses bind preferentially to human cell receptors more so than to avian cell receptors. Researchers at the Mill Hill laboratory anticipate that the Turkish virus will also have this characteristic.   Interpretation of the significance of this finding for human health will depend on clinical and epidemiological data now being gathered in Turkey.   All available evidence indicates that no sustained human-to-human transmission is occurring in any country experiencing human cases.   The present WHO level of pandemic alert remains at phase 3: human infections with a new virus subtype are occurring, but the vast majority of these infections are acquired directly from animals.  "

Although no poultry outbreaks have been officially reported in this province, it is located near areas with confirmed outbreaks in birds.   The situation in birds continues to evolve, with several new outbreaks under investigation in new parts of the country. All evidence to date indicates that patients have acquired their infections following close contact with diseased birds.   The Turkish government has launched an intensive public awareness campaign. Better public understanding of the disease, supported by more complete data on disease activity in birds, could help to reduce the risk of additional human cases, pending control of the disease in birds. As the majority of confirmed cases and persons under investigation are children, it is particularly important that messages about high-risk behaviours reach children.   Some 100,000 treatment courses of oseltamivir (Tamiflu) arrived in Turkey Friday evening.

The quality of laboratory testing at Turkey’s National Influenza Centre in Ankara is high. Results from tests conducted there last week were fully confirmed by a WHO collaborating laboratory in the United Kingdom. WHO considers it likely that test results on the newly announced cases will be confirmed by the UK laboratory, where samples are being sent for further analysis. H5N1 is the only strain within the H5 subtype known to infect humans. In the event of a confirmed H5N1 outbreak in birds, it is expected that human cases of avian influenza will be caused by the same virus strain.   The initial WHO team, accompanied by the Turkish Minister of Health, arrived in Van Province yesterday evening. The team is now investigating the epidemiological situation, assessing risk factors and control measures, and discussing with local authorities the possible need for additional equipment and supplies. The team will also be assessing patients at the Van hospital where some 38 people are currently being treated and evaluated for possible H5N1 infection.   The initial investigation has found no evidence that the virus has increased its transmissibility or is spreading from person to person. Most persons under investigation are children, often from the same family, and almost all have a documented link to dead or diseased poultry.   Outbreaks in poultry are now known to be occurring in several parts of the country. In recent days, the Ministry of Agriculture has confirmed H5N1 outbreaks in birds in 10 of the country’s 81 provinces. Extensive culling is under way, and several other possible outbreaks are under investigation.   With the agreement of the Ministry of Health, two epidemiologists and two experts in laboratory diagnosis will join the initial WHO team in the next few days. Given the present high level of awareness of the disease and its presence in poultry in several parts of the country, the number of people concerned about possible exposure is expected to increase. This additional support should expedite understanding of the epidemiological situation and increase the capacity to rapidly confirm or rule out persons under investigation for possible infection.  "
"2006","http://www.who.int/csr/don/2006_01_07/en/index.html"," Avian influenza – situation in Turkey - update   7 January 2006   The Ministry of Health in Turkey has confirmed an additional two cases of human infection with the H5N1 avian influenza virus. Both cases are children, aged five and eight years, and both are hospitalized. This brings the total number of laboratory confirmed cases in Turkey to four. Two of these cases were fatal.   A WHO collaborating laboratory in the United Kingdom has today confirmed detection of the H5N1 virus in samples taken from the two fatal cases.   The Ministry of Health has also announced a third death, presumably caused by the H5N1 virus, in a 12-year-old girl. The girl, who died on 6 January, is a sibling of the two children who died. A fourth child in the family, a six-year-old boy, is also hospitalized. Tests on samples from these patients are ongoing; neither is laboratory confirmed at present.   According to Turkish authorities, some 30 patients are being treated and evaluated for possible H5N1 infection at a hospital in Van Province. Most of the patients are children, and the majority come from the rural district of Dogubayazit.   Plans for a team of international experts to travel today to Van Province have been deferred because of adverse weather conditions. Government officials are assisting the team in finding a rapid mode of transportation to the affected area in the eastern part of the country.   To date, all evidence indicates that patients have acquired their infections following close contact with diseased poultry. Contact between people and poultry has likely increased during the present cold weather, when the custom among many rural households is to bring poultry into their homes. Tests have shown that the virus can survive in bird faeces for at least 35 days at low temperatures (4 o C).   Based on experiences during the avian H5N1 outbreaks in Asia, behaviours that carry an especially high risk of infection include the slaughtering, defeathering, butchering, and preparation for consumption of diseased poultry. These behaviours tend to occur most frequently in rural areas where populations traditionally slaughter and consume birds once deaths or signs of illness are seen in poultry flocks.   In recent days, vigilance for outbreaks of the disease in poultry has increased considerably. Outbreaks of highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza have now been confirmed in six provinces in the eastern and south-eastern part of the country. Outbreaks at additional sites in the area are under investigation.   Avoidance of high-risk behaviours remains the most important way for local populations to protect themselves from infection.  "
"2006","http://www.who.int/csr/don/2006_01_05/en/index.html"," Avian influenza – situation in Turkey   5 January 2006   The Ministry of Health in Turkey has confirmed its first two cases of human infection with avian influenza caused by the H5 virus subtype. Both cases were fatal.   The first case was a 14-year-old boy from the rural district of Dogubayazit, in the eastern province of Agri, which borders the Islamic Republic of Iran and Armenia.  He was hospitalized in Van Province on 1 January and died the same day. The second case was his 15-year-old sister, also hospitalized on 1 January. She died on 5 January.   Earlier this week, Turkish authorities had ruled out avian influenza in these cases based on preliminary test results from samples taken from the nose and throat. Subsequent tests of additional patient specimens taken from the lungs produced positive results. Patient samples were sent today to a WHO collaborating centre in the United Kingdom for further analysis. The samples have now arrived; results are expected within the next days.   Turkish health authorities have informed WHO that, since 1 January, a total of 11 patients (including the two confirmed fatal cases) have been hospitalized in Van Province with symptoms suggesting infection with avian influenza. Most patients are children between the ages of six and fifteen years and all reside in the Dogubayazit district. Two of the children are siblings of the two confirmed cases.   Following a request by the Ministry of Health, an initial team of experts from WHO, the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control and the European Commission is travelling today to Turkey to collaborate with the authorities in their investigation of the situation.   Initial information about the confirmed cases suggests that the children acquired their infection following close contact with chickens. Deaths of chickens are known to have occurred in the Dogubayazit district near the end of last year. Although no poultry outbreak has been officially reported in the district, a confirmed outbreak of H5N1 avian influenza in chickens and ducks was reported on 27 December in the adjacent province of Igdir.   National authorities have informed WHO that Dogubayazit district has been placed under quarantine; no people or animals are allowed to move in or out of the district. Culling operations are currently under way.   The two Turkish cases mark the first confirmed reports of human infection with avian influenza outside East Asia. Since January 2004, a total of 142 human cases of H5N1 infection have been reported in Viet Nam, Thailand, Cambodia, Indonesia, and China. The cases in Turkey bring the number of affected countries to six, from which 144 cases have now been reported.   Turkey reported its first outbreak of H5N1 avian influenza in poultry in mid-October of last year. That outbreak, which occurred in the northwestern part of the country, was attributed to contact between domestic poultry and migratory waterfowl. The outbreak in Igdir and other suspected outbreaks in this part of the country are thought to have occurred following introduction of the virus by migratory birds. The region, which has several large lakes, is known to lie along migratory routes.  "

Fifteen localities in White Nile, Sinnar, and Gazeera states are affected. More than 25 human samples have proved positive for Rift Valley fever by PCR or ELISA testing. Laboratory results from three cases in Khartoum state have been found negative for RVF. Results of tests on animal samples remain unavailable.   The appearance of RVF disease in humans is typically preceded by infection in animals. The RVF virus circulates between ruminant animals (cattle, sheep, goats, and camels) via mosquitoes. During an outbreak, the most significant risk factor for human infection is close contact with infected domestic animals, particularly with their body fluids either directly or via aerosols. However, at times of high vector densities the relative importance of mosquito-to-human transmission may increase.   With no specific treatment and no effective human vaccine, intensive social mobilization to raise awareness of the risk factors of RVF infection and the protective measures individuals can take to prevent exposure, is the only way to reduce human infection and deaths.   During RVF outbreaks, intensive public health messages for risk reduction should focus on:  reducing the risk of animal-to-human transmission as a result of unsafe animal husbandry and slaughtering practices. Gloves and other appropriate protective clothing should be worn and care taken when handling sick animals or their tissues or when slaughtering animals.  reducing the risk of animal-to-human transmission arising from the unsafe consumption of fresh blood, raw milk or animal tissue. In the epizootic regions, all animal products (blood, meat and milk) should be thoroughly cooked before eating.  the importance of personal and community protection against mosquito bites through the use of impregnated mosquito nets, personal insect repellent if available, by wearing light coloured clothing (long-sleeved shirts and trousers) and by avoiding outdoor activity at peak biting times of the vector species.   WHO continues to work closely with the Sudan Ministry of Health, as well as other UN and international bodies to support an effective control program for protecting human populations.

It is estimated that more than 30 000 people have fallen ill with acute watery diarrhoea, among which 3 315 were identified as positive for Vibrio cholerae , the bacterium causing the disease. A total of 14 people are known to have died of the disease. The case-fatality rate has remained low throughout the outbreak indicating that those who have become sick have been able to access adequate treatment on time.   The disease is continuing to spread across Iraq and dissemination to as yet unaffected areas remains highly possible. Epidemiological curves are still rising in the provinces from which the majority of laboratory-confirmed cases have originated, Kirkuk (2309) and Sulaymaniah (870). An increasing number of cases of acute watery diarrhoea has also been reported in Diala, a province neighbouring Baghdad. Although V. cholerae has not yet been laboratory confirmed, the clinical symptoms indicate the presence of cholera. The numbers of cases are remaining stable in Basra, Baghdad, Dahuk, Mosul and Tikrit. However, a case has now been confirmed in Wasit, a province that has previously been unaffected by the outbreak.   The Government of Iraq has mobilized a multi-sectoral response to the outbreak. Specific control measures have been reinforced and preventive measures to reduce the risk of transmission to unaffected areas have been put in place. However, the overall quality of water and sanitation is very poor, a factor known to greatly facilitate cholera contamination. WHO is in the process of procuring 5,000,000 water-treatment tablets and two international WHO epidemiologists are being deployed to support the Ministry of Health in Iraq.   WHO does not recommend any restrictions to travel or trade to or from affected areas as a means to control the spread of cholera. However, neighbouring countries are encouraged to reinforce their active surveillance and preparedness systems. Mass chemoprophylaxis is strongly discouraged, as it has no effect on the spread of cholera, can have adverse effects by increasing antimicrobial resistance and provides a false sense of security.   Use of the current internationally available prequalified oral cholera vaccine is not recommended once an outbreak has started due to its 2-dose regimen and the time required to reach protective efficacy, high cost and the heavy logistics associated with its use. The use of the parenteral cholera vaccine has never been recommended by WHO due to its low protective efficacy and the high occurrence of severe adverse reactions.

Both patients had been on treatment with oseltamivir for two days before the clinical samples that yielded the viruses were taken.   The two patients from whom samples were taken were a 16 year-old female and a 26 year-old male from Gharbiyah Province, Egypt. 1 They were a niece and uncle, respectively, who lived in the same house. The girl was admitted to a hospital on 19 December 2006, while the man was admitted on 17 December. On 21 December they began receiving 2 tablets per day of oseltamivir. On 23 December they were moved to a referral hospital. The samples which have so far been tested were taken from the two patients on 23 December. The girl died on 25 December and the man died on 28 December 2006.   In this and all other H5N1 investigations there is close, ongoing coordination between Egypt's Ministry of Health and Population (MOH&P) and WHO. It was Egypt's monitoring and rapid virological analysis conducted at the Central Public Health Laboratory in Cairo that initially allowed the diagnoses of H5N1 to be made. Confirmatory testing and genetic sequencing was done at NAMRU-3 and at two WHO Collaborating Centres located in Atlanta, USA and London, UK.   At this time there is no indication that oseltamivir resistance is widespread in Egypt or elsewhere. WHO is not making any changes in antiviral treatment recommendations for H5N1-infected persons published in June 2006 because the clinical level of resistance of these mutations is not yet well established. Current laboratory testing suggests that the level of reduced susceptibility is moderate. This mutation has previously been identified in Viet Nam in one case in 2005. Moreover, these mutations are not associated with any known change in the transmissibility of the virus between humans. Based on these considerations, the public health implications at this time are limited. Finally, these findings do not indicate a need for a change in phase level. The WHO pandemic preparedness level remains at three.   The Egyptian authorities, WHO and its Collaborating Centres will continue to share with the public all relevant information from the on-going investigations and analyses as soon as it becomes available.   1 The ages and dates in this update related to the two patients, may differ slightly from earlier reports, but reflect the most recent information provided to WHO.

Cases are now being reported from all 10 of the country's provinces. Harare, particularly Budiriro suburb in the south west, accounts for the majority of cases, followed by Beitbridge in Matabeleland South and Mudzi in Mashonaland East. The current outbreak is the largest ever recorded in Zimbabwe and is not yet under control. In fact, the epidemiological week ending 20 December saw over 5 000 new cases - an increase in the number of weekly cases relative to previous weeks - and an increase in deaths outside treatment/health centres.   The overall Case Fatality Rate (CFR) has risen to 5.7% - far above the 1% which is normal in large outbreaks - and in some rural areas it has reached as high as 50%. Mortality outside of healthcare facilities remains very high. This is a clear indication that better case management and access to healthcare is needed - in particular an increased use of oral rehydration therapy with Oral Rehydration Salts in communities very early after onset of the disease.   The outbreak has taken on a subregional dimension with cases being reported from neighboring countries. In South Africa as of 26 December, 1 279 cumulative cases and 12 deaths (CFR of 0.9%) had been recorded, with the bulk of the cases (1 194) in the Limpopo area. Cases have also been reported in Botswana (Palm Tree).   The current situation is closely linked to the lack of safe drinking water, poor sanitation, declining health infrastructure, and reduced numbers of healthcare staff reporting to work. Other current risk factors include the commencement of the rainy season and the movement of people within the country, and possibly across borders, during the Christmas season. WHO, together with the Ministry of Health and partners from the health and Water and Sanitation clusters, has established a cholera outbreak response coordination unit in order to strengthen the reporting and early detection of cases, improve the response mechanism and access to healthcare and ensure proper case management. WHO has also deployed experts in public health, water and sanitation, logistics and social mobilization. In light of the extent and pace of expansion of the outbreak, reinforcing all control activities across the country is critical.   Given the current dynamic of the outbreak and the context of the collapsed health system, a cholera vaccination is not recommended. Moreover, the use of the internationally available WHO prequalified oral cholera vaccine is not recommended once an outbreak has started due to its 2-dose regimen and the time required to reach protective efficacy, high cost and the heavy logistics associated to its use. The use of the parenteral cholera vaccine has never been recommended by WHO due to its low protective efficacy and the occurrence of severe adverse events.   In controlling the spread of cholera WHO does not recommend any special restrictions to travel or trade to or from affected areas. However, neighboring countries are encouraged to reinforce their active surveillance and preparedness systems. Mass chemoprophylaxis is strongly discouraged, as it has no effect on the spread of cholera, can have adverse effects by increasing antimicrobial resistance and provides a false sense of security.  "

Reports have also been received from the Ministries of Health in neighbouring countries confirming cholera cases have occurred in Musina (South Africa), Palm Tree (Botswana) and Guro district (Mozambique).   Cholera outbreaks have become more frequent in Zimbabwe since the early 1990s. However, with the exception of the large outbreaks that occurred in 1999 and 2002, the disease has been kept under control through intensified prevention and preparedness activities.

Recent interruptions to the water supplies, together with overcrowding, are aggravating factors in this epidemic. ZINWA (Zimbabwe National Water Authority) has pledged to correct the water supply and sewage system as a matter of urgency.   The Ministry of Health and WHO, together with its health sector partners (UNICEF, IOM, OXFAM-GB, Medecins du Monde, ICRC, ACF,  MSF‐Spain - Holland & Luxemburg, Plan International, GOAL, Save the Children-UK and others), have established a comprehensive and coordinated cholera response operational plan to address the needs of the population in the affected areas, emphasizing a multi-sectoral response.

As of 28 September 2008, a total of 341 laboratory-confirmed cholera cases, including five deaths, had been verified (case-fatality rate: 1.5%). Nine provinces have already been affected, with Babil accounting for the majority of cases (58%), followed by Baghdad (18%) and Kerbala (9%). Other provinces in which cholera cases have been reported include Anbar, Basra, Diala, Diwanyia, Misan and Najaf.   In addition to the confirmed cholera cases, there are a further 31 suspected cases currently under investigation and seven fatal cases of acute watery diarrhoea with symptoms similar to those of cholera.   Although the outbreak this year appears to be less intense then that of 2007, further waves are still possible. It is therefore too early to consider this epidemic to be under control. In addition, long-term inadequacies in the area of water and sanitation remain of immediate concern and cholera outbreaks will recur in Iraq until access to safe water and proper sanitation is ensured for all people.   In response to a request from the Ministry of Health, WHO is providing technical support. The WHO regional expert for water and sanitation has arrived in Baghdad and a joint WHO-UNICEF assessment mission to Babil and Misan will take place as soon as the security situation allows.   WHO does not recommend any restrictions to travel or trade to or from affected areas as a means to control the spread of cholera. However, neighbouring countries are encouraged to reinforce their active surveillance and preparedness systems. Mass chemoprophylaxis is strongly discouraged, as it has no effect on the spread of cholera, can have adverse effects by increasing antimicrobial resistance and provides a false sense of security.   Use of the current internationally available prequalified oral cholera vaccine is not recommended once an outbreak has started due to its 2-dose regimen and the time required to reach protective efficacy as well as the high costs and the heavy logistics associated with its use. The use of the parenteral cholera vaccine has never been recommended by WHO due to its low protective efficacy and the high occurrence of severe adverse reactions.

The cases have been laboratory confirmed by the Institut Pasteur, Dakar. The first case was reported in a 24 year old male living in the sub-prefecture of Bounouma, Prefecture of N'zérékoré: the man reported first seeing symptoms on 26 July and blood samples were taken on 4 and 5 August. The second case was reported in the third week of August in the Urbain Commune of N'zérékoré in another 24 year old male. Both cases had no history of yellow fever vaccinations.   A  yellow fever outbreak investigation team composed of  experts from the MoH and WHO visited 10 sub-prefectures and the Urbain Commune of N'zérékoré and two others sub-prefectures in the Prefecture of Lola from the 5th to the 14th of September.   The mission concluded that: (i) according to the yellow fever case definition, 14 suspected cases were found retrospectively, one of these cases died having presented with symptoms of fever and jaundice; (ii) Most of the prefectures were vaccinated in 2005 with a reported coverage of 95,2%; (iii) The only areas where a low coverage rate was reported  (45%) were Bounama sub-prefecture, Urbain Commune and the Ivorian Refugee Camp of Kouankan 2.   On the basis of these results, the Ministry of Health decided to carry out a reactive mass vaccination campaign in these three areas, in October 2008, targeting 140 342 people. The campaign will be conducted with the technical assistance of WHO and the support of the GAVI alliance (the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization). The MoH has submitted a request for yellow fever vaccines from the global emergency stockpile, managed by the International Coordinating Group on Vaccine Provision for Yellow Fever Control (YF-ICG).

As of 21 September, 7 166 cases had been reported throughout the country, among whom 133 people had died. The overall case-fatality rate stands at 1.9%, and decreases below 1% for hospitalized cases. However, the case-fatality rate reaches 9% in remote areas, indicating that rural populations affected by cholera do not have access to treatment rapidly enough to save lives. The fact that Bissau, the capital, accounts for more than 70% of all cases but only 31% of deaths also illustrates this issue. The areas with the highest attack rates are Bissau, Biombo, Bijagos and Oio. Cholera epidemics regularly resurge in Guinea-Bissau. In 2005-2006, cholera affected 25 111 people and killed 399.   Numerous national and international partners are supporting the Ministry of Health. Médecins sans Frontières (MSF-Spain) took charge of cholera treatment centres by building local capacity, and improving early detection and treatment of cases through systematic patient home visits. UNICEF is providing technical expertise and material in the area of water and sanitation;  WHO has deployed an epidemiologist. A team from The US Centers for Disease Control (CDC), together with an expert team from Brazil, have also arrived in the country.  In addition, efforts are being made to strengthen community mobilization, health and hygiene education, and to de-stigmatize cholera among potentially-affected populations.   Cholera is mainly transmitted through contaminated water and food and is closely linked to inadequate environmental management. In many areas of Guinea-Bissau, basic infrastructures appear to be largely inefficient. The overall quality of water and sanitation remains very poor, therefore facilitating cholera transmission. Long-term prevention of cholera depends on access to safe water and adequate sanitation to prevent exposure and interrupt transmission. In addition, corpses of deceased cholera patients should be handled with extreme caution and correctly disinfected before proceeding with the burial ceremony to avoid further contamination.   WHO does not recommend any restrictions to travel or trade to or from affected areas as a means to control the spread of cholera.  For more information   WHO cholera fact sheet   "

They constitute the first cholera cases detected in Iraq in 2008. By 28 August, seven cases had been laboratory confirmed, and a further 174 cases were suspected as cholera, bringing the total number of reported cases to 181 (128 in Missan and 53 in Baghdad). In the first week of September, the outbreak spread to Babil Province, south of Baghdad, where 116 suspect cases have now been identified. The presence of Vibrio cholerae , the bacterium causing the disease, has been confirmed in 21 cases. To date there have been 10 fatalities, three of whom tested positive for Vibrio cholera .   The re-emergence of cholera this year is not unexpected: in September 2007, the country was affected by a large outbreak (4696 cases with 24 deaths). The outbreak occurred mainly in northern Iraq, but sporadic cases were also detected in other provinces.   The Government of Iraq has mobilized a multi-sectoral response to the outbreak. Specific control measures have been reinforced and preventive measures to reduce the risk of transmission to unaffected areas have been put in place. Building on last year's experience, the Ministry of Health, together with WHO, have put in place an effective surveillance system that was able to capture the very first cases of cholera, enabling a timely response and facilitating the containment of the outbreak.   However, the overall quality of water and sanitation remains very poor, a factor known to greatly facilitate cholera contamination. Experience has shown that long term-prevention of cholera depends on access to safe water and adequate sanitation to prevent exposure and interrupt transmission. Improving water and sanitation infrastructures is therefore a long-term goal of WHO and its partners in Iraq and, in times of outbreaks, it is essential that immediate measures, such as water treatment at household level, health education and proper case management, are implemented rapidly.  To this end, the Government of Iraq is providing chlorine tablets to families and is intensifying social mobilization activities.   In response to a request from the Ministry of Health, WHO is providing technical support, particularly in the area of laboratory testing.

The outbreak was laboratory confirmed at the beginning of May 2008.   In June 2008, WHO deployed a GOARN mission (the Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network) of two experts in order to assess the epidemiological and entomological situation and to investigate the risk of a full scale urban yellow fever outbreak.   After clinical, epidemiological and laboratory investigation, the GOARN mission confirmed two yellow fever cases. The cases were reported in different health districts of the capital, Abidjan. One case is a 48 year old female from Cocody, who was vaccinated against yellow fever in 1997, and the second is a 20 year old male from the urban area of Treichville, who has never been vaccinated against yellow fever.   The following conclusions were drawn by the GOARN mission: (i) the epidemiological situation is that of a temporal cluster of yellow fever cases without geographic focus and without continuation at present; (ii) although a mass vaccination campaign was conducted in 2001, the actual yellow fever vaccination coverage is likely to be around or below 60%; (iii) vectors capable of transmitting yellow fever are present in Abidjan; and (iv) the entomological risk indices (Breteau index and Container index) were over the threshold in all localities investigated, indicating a high risk of yellow fever transmission.   As a result, the mission recommends that the surveillance system to detect new yellow fever cases is strengthened and that vector control measures are implemented.   Subsequent to the mission, in July 2008, a further three laboratory confirmed cases were reported by the Ministry of Health. In addition to the standard IgM tests, more specific tests were used for all cases at the regional reference laboratory, Institut Pasteur in Dakar, Senegal, to determine the presence of the yellow fever virus and to exclude the presence of any other haemorrhagic fevers.   To date, the Ministry of Health has reported a total of nine suspected cases of yellow fever, including the five confirmed cases.   On the basis of these results, the Ministry of Health has decided to carry out a mass vaccination campaign in Abidjan, in August 2008, targeting 1 938 161 people. The campaign will be conducted with the technical assistance of WHO and the support of the GAVI alliance (the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization).

Marburg virus infection has been demonstrated by laboratory tests performed by the Bernhard Nocht Institute in Hamburg, Germany.   The 40-year-old woman travelled in Uganda from 5-28 June, 2008, and entered caves on two occasions. The first cave was visited on 16 June at Fort Portal. No bats were seen in this cave. She was reportedly exposed to fruit bats during a visit to the “python cave” in the Maramagambo Forest between Queen Elisabeth Park and Kabale on 19 June. This cave is thought to harbour bat species that have been found to carry filoviruses in other locations in sub-Saharan Africa. Filoviruses cause two types of viral haemorrhagic fever: Marburg and Ebola. A large bat population was seen in the cave and the woman is reported to have  had direct contact with one bat.   The woman returned to the Netherlands on 28 June in good health. The first symptoms (fever, chills) occurred on 2 July and she was admitted to hospital on 5 July. Rapid clinical deterioration with liver failure and severe haemorrhaging occurred on 7 July. The patient remains in a critical clinical condition.   Contact tracing and temperature monitoring have been initiated for unprotected contacts with a history of possible exposure to the case after 2 July. Although further epidemiological investigation is needed to exclude other possible sites of exposure to MHF virus, as a precaution Dutch authorities have alerted the tour operator to avoid visits to the caves until further information is available.   No citizens of other countries were involved in this trip except for a local tour guide, but the cave in the Maramagambo Forrest is known to be a tourist attraction. No measures were taken with respect to the passengers on the flight from Uganda as the flight occurred four days before the onset of symptoms in the patient.   WHO has informed the Ministry of Health Uganda which will take appropriate steps nationally to investigate these events, and WHO has recommended that the MoH advise all residents and travellers to avoid entering caves with bat populations.

In addition, siblings and mothers of the dead children were found to have extremely high blood lead concentrations, in many cases above 1000 μg/L (in children, a concentration above 100 μg/L may impair neurological development, and 700 μg/L is considered to require immediate action).   Following a formal request from Senegal, WHO has deployed an international team consisting of a clinical toxicologist, an environmental health specialist and analytical chemist. This team has conducted clinical examinations and further environmental investigations in NGagne Diaw. Clinical examinations have confirmed continuing high blood lead concentrations in the original group studied, as well as in a randomly-selected group of adults and children who were not involved in lead recycling. Many children are showing evidence of neurological damage. Environmental investigations have found very high concentrations of lead both outside and inside peoples' homes. These have been mapped to an area inhabited by approximately 950 people, who are continuously exposed through ingestion and inhalation of lead-contaminated dust.   WHO has advised the Senegalese authorities about the need for urgent action to terminate exposure of the affected population to lead, and to provide chelation and other therapy to  children with high blood lead concentrations. Chelation therapy in children who continue to be exposed to lead is ineffective and may exacerbate toxicity. Plans are in hand to hospitalize the worst-affected cases, but they will then need to be able to return to a lead-free environment. WHO has provided chelating agents, and the clinical toxicologist has started training local medical staff. Further systematic investigation of the population of NGagne Diaw is needed, as well as the administration of appropriate treatment.  Thorough decontamination of the affected area of NGagne Diaw, including the insides of homes, is a high priority.   To deal effectively with this environmental and public health emergency the Senegalese authorities will require urgent technical and financial assistance from the international community. WHO is briefing its UN and other partners about the situation in order to facilitate the provision of the necessary resources.

In 2008, a nine-fold increase in new cases caused by this serotype has been reported compared with the same period in 2007. This outbreak in northern Nigeria has the potential to cause major international outbreaks, as occurred in 2003-2006. This year, Nigeria accounts for 86% of WPV1 cases in the world.   This new outbreak in Nigeria has occurred because upwards of 20% of children remain unimmunized in key high-risk areas for polio in the north of the country.  From 2003 to 2006, an outbreak in northern Nigeria led to national and international spread of the disease, eventually re-infecting 20 previously polio-free countries, causing outbreaks in places as far away as Indonesia and Yemen, and resulting in 1,475 cases in these 20 countries.   New  WPV1 genetically linked to viruses from northern Nigeria has now been confirmed in Benin (one case, onset 17 April 2008) and the western part of Niger (1 case, in Tillaberry province, close to the borders with Burkina Faso and Mali; onset 11 April 2008). It is from these areas that WPV1 originating from Nigeria spread across west, central and the Horn of Africa in 2003-2004, re-infecting – among others – Côte d'Ivoire, Ghana, Guinea and Togo. In addition to international spread of WPV1 from northern Nigeria, wild poliovirus type 3 (WPV3) originating from northern Nigeria has been reported from Chad (onset of most recent case 13 April 2008).   The risk of renewed international spread of polio from Nigeria is increasing due to the intensity of the outbreak in northern Nigeria, the upcoming rainy season which is associated with increased transmission of poliovirus, and the anticipated large-scale population movements for the Hajj (pilgrimage to Mecca, Saudi Arabia) in the second half of 2008. Saudi Arabia has been notified of the increased risk of polio infection to Hajj pilgrims.   Nigeria has planned two large-scale rounds of emergency polio immunization in the northern states in July and August 2008. Large-scale emergency polio immunization campaigns were conducted on 13-16 June in high-risk and border areas of Benin, Burkina Faso, Mali and Niger, followed by additional campaigns in July.

No specific anti-viral therapy is available and treatment focuses on prevention of complications. As there is no vaccine for this virus, control measures during outbreaks are focused on classical hygiene measures including frequent hand-washing and disinfection of soiled clothing and surfaces. In certain situations, it may be advisable to close child-care facilities and schools to reduce the intensity of transmission. It is not necessary to restrict travel or trade.   Currently many countries in the Western Pacific region have implemented heightened surveillance for hand, foot and mouth disease and for severe complications in children.

Another cluster with 4 clinically compatible cases occurred in the urban area of San Lorenzo municipality, 20 km from Asuncion. Final confirmation of these 4 cases is pending.   The Ministry of Health has strengthened public health containment measures in the affected areas. Integrated control measures involving mass vaccination for people living in, or travelling to, the affected area; vector control; and heightened surveillance are underway to prevent serious public health consequences given the current low level of immunization among the people living in the affected area.   A PAHO team of experts including an epidemiologist, clinician/virologist, risk communicator, immunization advisers and emergency management experts was deployed to Paraguay on 15 February. A laboratory scientist from IEC Instituto Evandro Chagas (Brazil) will join the national public health laboratory shortly.

Twenty three of these cases have been laboratory confirmed. The laboratory confirmed cases were reported from the three states of Goias, Distrito Federal and Mato Grosso do Sol. The first confirmed case was on 17 Dec 2007. Twenty one confirmed cases had never been vaccinated for yellow fever and the other 2 were last vaccinated over 20 years ago.   This outbreak of yellow fever follows an epizootic outbreak in monkeys that started in April 2007 and has since spread to 80 municipalities. An increase in the number of epizootic events was observed between December 2007 and January 2008, reaching more than 23 new municipalities in that period.   Brazil has suspended exports of yellow fever vaccine from Bio-Manguinhos, one of three WHO pre-qualified manufacturers of yellow fever vaccine, based in Brazil, in order to meet the needs of the country to respond to this outbreak.   On 18 January, the Brazilian Ministry of Health submitted a request to borrow an additional 4 million doses of vaccine from the global emergency stockpile managed by the International Coordinating Group on Vaccine Provision for Yellow Fever Control (YF-ICG), in order to complete the required levels of yellow fever vaccines stocks held nationally to enable an emergency vaccination campaign.   The campaign which targets approx 7 million people, in the most affected states will be carried out in early February. Due to the coordinated efforts between the ICG and United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) Supply Division, the 4 millions doses arrived in Brazil in early February.

WHO is actively monitoring the progress of the pandemic through frequent consultations with the WHO Regional Offices and member states and through monitoring of multiple sources of data.  Situation update:   The most active areas of pandemic influenza transmission currently are in central and eastern Europe. Focal increases in rates of ILI/ARI during recent weeks were reported in at least three eastern European countries, Georgia, Montenegro, and Ukraine. A high intensity of respiratory diseases activity with concurrent circulation of pandemic influenza persists in parts of southern and eastern Europe, particularly in Greece, Poland, Bulgaria, Serbia, Ukraine, and the Urals Region of the Russian Federation. In Western Europe, influenza transmission remains active and widespread, but overall disease activity has peaked. At least 13 of 21 countries (testing more than 20 sentinel samples) reported that 30% or more of sentinel specimens were positive for influenza, down from a peak of over 70%. All were influenza viruses detected in Western Europe were pandemic H1N1 2009, however, very small numbers of seasonal influenza viruses, making up less than 1% of all influenza viruses detected, were reported in Russia. In addition, limited available data indicates that active, high intensity transmission is occurring in Northern African countries along the Mediterranean coast (Algeria, Tunisia, and Egypt).   In Central Asia, limited data suggest that influenza virus circulation remains active, but transmission may have recently peaked in some places. In West Asia, Israel, Iran, Iraq, Oman, and Afghanistan also appear to have passed their peak period of transmission within the past month, though both areas continue to have some active transmission and levels of respiratory disease activity have not yet returned to baseline levels.   In East Asia, influenza transmission remains active but appears to be declining overall. Influenza/ILI activity continued to decline in Japan, in northern and southern China, Chinese Taipei, and Hong Kong SAR (China). Slight increases in ILI were reported in Mongolia after weeks of declining activity following a large peak of activity over one month ago. In southern Asia, influenza activity continues to be intense, particularly in northern India, Nepal, and, Sri Lanka.  Seasonal influenza A (H3N2) viruses are still being detected in very small numbers in China making up about 2.5% of the influenza A viruses detected there.   In North America, influenza transmission remains widespread but has declined substantially in all countries. In the US, sentinel outpatient ILI activity has returned to the seasonal baseline, and indicators of severity, including hospitalizations, paediatric mortality, and P&I mortality have declined substantially since peaking during late October. Rates of hospitalization among cases aged 5-17 years and 18-49 year far exceeded rates observed during recent influenza seasons, while rates of hospitalizations among cases aged >65 years were far lower than those observed during recent influenza seasons.   In the tropical regions of Central and South America and the Caribbean, influenza transmission remains geographically widespread but overall disease activity has been declining or remains unchanged in most parts, except for focal increases in respiratory disease activity in a few countries. In the temperate regions of the southern hemisphere, sporadic cases of pandemic influenza continued to be reported without evidence of sustained community transmission.   The Global Influenza Surveillance Network (GISN) continues monitoring the global circulation of influenza viruses, including pandemic, seasonal and other influenza viruses infecting, or with the potential to infect, humans including seasonal influenza.

WHO is actively monitoring the progress of the pandemic through frequent consultations with the WHO Regional Offices and member states and through monitoring of multiple sources of data.  Situation update:   In the temperate zone* of the northern hemisphere, transmission of pandemic influenza virus remains active and geographically widespread, however overall disease activity has recently peaked in much of the hemisphere. There continues to be increases in influenza activity in later affected areas of central and eastern Europe, and in parts of west, central, and south Asia.   In United States and Canada, influenza activity continues to be geographically widespread but overall levels of ILI** have declined substantially to near the national baseline level in the US and below the seasonal baseline in Canada. Although numbers of hospitalizations and death in US have declined steadily since their peak over 6 weeks ago, the proportional mortality due to pneumonia and influenza (P&I mortality) remains elevated above the epidemic threshold for the 11th consecutive week. In Canada, rates of ILI, numbers of outbreaks, and proportions of samples testing positive for influenza have declined substantially since peaking six weeks ago. Approximately 53% of hospitalized cases in Canada had an underlying medical condition; cases with underlying medical conditions tended to be older (compared to those without), and were at increased risk of hospitalization and death.  Also from Canada, a smaller proportion of hospitalized cases during the winter transmission season compared with those hospitalized cases during the summer transmission season, were persons of aboriginal origin (3.9% vs. 20.3%).   In Europe, geographically widespread and active transmission of pandemic influenza virus continued to be observed throughout the continent, however, overall pandemic influenza activity appears to have recently peaked across a majority of countries. At least ten countries reported that 30% or more of their sentinel respiratory specimens had tested positive for influenza. Greater than 98% of subtyped influenza A viruses detected in Europe were pandemic H1N1 2009, however, seasonal influenza viruses (H1N1, H3N2, and type B) continue to be detected at low levels. Of note, a few countries are experiencing increasing disease activity and have yet to peak (Hungary and Montenegro ), while several others are experiencing a resurgence in activity (Serbia, Ukraine, Georgia, and Turkey). Rates of ILI have returned to near seasonal baselines in the earlier affected areas of western Europe (Belgium, the Netherlands, Ireland, and Iceland) and a substantial decline in activity has been observed in much of northern Europe over the past month. In central and southern Europe, where influenza virus transmission has been most active recently, disease activity in most places has either plateaued (Albania, Czech Republic, Estonia) or begun to decline (Austria, Germany, Poland, Latvia, Croatia, Slovakia, and Greece). Further east, influenza activity appears to be variable, with the Russian Federation reporting a steady decline in rates of ARI after a recent peak three weeks ago; while several other countries are reporting increases in rates of ILI/ARI (Ukraine and Georgia). In Europe, the highest rates of ILI have been recorded among children 0-4 years of age (in 15 countries) and among older children 5-14 years of age (in 18 countries). Detections of RSV in Europe continued to  increase over the past six weeks, partially accounting for elevated ILI activity among young children in some countries.   In Western and Central Asia, limited data suggest that influenza virus circulation remains active throughout the region, however disease trends remain variable.  Increasing respiratory diseases activity continued to be reported in Kazakhstan and in Egypt; while several others countries, Israel and Oman, have been reporting declining trends of respiratory diseases activity after recording a peak of activity approximately one month ago.   In East Asia, the situation remains similar to last week; influenza transmission remains active but appears to be declining overall. Influenza/ILI activity has recently peaked and continues to decline in Japan, in northern and southern China, Chinese Taipei and in Mongolia. In southern Asia, influenza activity continues to increase in the northern India, Nepal, and, Sri Lanka.

In the US, proportional mortality due to pneumonia and influenza (P&I mortality) has remained consistently elevated above the epidemic threshold for the past 10 weeks; however, weekly numbers of lab-confirmed hospitalizations and deaths continue to decline over the past month.   The preliminary analysis of data from Northern Hemisphere countries that have now passed through an entire season of winter transmission indicate that the mortality rate, as expressed in fatal cases per million people, is in the same range as that which was observed in the Southern Hemisphere winter. This would indicate that the overall severity of the pandemic has not changed although the proportion of the population infected has been much higher in the temperate countries of the Northern Hemisphere during their winter season compared to the circulation observed in their summer season.   In Europe, geographically widespread and active transmission of pandemic influenza virus continued to be observed across the continent. At least 10 countries, mostly in western and northern Europe, reported declining respiratory disease activity. During the last reporting period, ILI/ARI activity continued to increase or reach a plateau in a limited number of countries: the Czech Republic, Estonia,, Hungary, Montenegro and Switzerland (a range of 28-71% of sentinel respiratory samples were positive for influenza in these countries). A high intensity of respiratory disease activity was reported in parts of northern and south-eastern Europe and in parts of the Russian Federation. 99% of subtyped influenza A viruses in Europe were pandemic H1N1 2009. Detections of RSV in Europe continued to increase over the past five weeks, partially accounting for elevated ILI activity among young children in some countries.   In Western and Central Asia, influenza transmission remains active. ILI/ARI activity continues to increase in Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan, and has peaked in some countries including in Afghanistan, Oman, and Israel. Influenza virus continues to circulate in Iran, Iraq, Jordan, Egypt and in much of the surrounding region but may have recently peaked in some parts.   In East Asia, influenza transmission remains active but appears to be declining overall. Influenza activity has recently peaked and begun to decline in Japan. ILI activity continued to decline but remained elevated in northern and southern China, Chinese Taipei and in Mongolia.  In southern Asia, influenza activity continues to increase in the northern parts of India, Nepal, Sri Lanka, and the Maldives.   In the tropical region of Central and South America and the Caribbean, influenza transmission remains geographically widespread but overall disease activity has been declining.   Pandemic H1N1 2009 virus appears to be the predominant influenza virus circulating in northern and eastern Africa. In West Africa, a mixture of pandemic and seasonal influenza viruses have been detected. Seasonal viruses have included both seasonal H1N1 and H3N2, with the later predominating.   In the temperate region of the southern hemisphere, sporadic cases of pandemic influenza are being reported without evidence of sustained community transmission.   The Global Influenza Surveillance Network (GISN) continues monitoring the global circulation of influenza viruses, including pandemic, seasonal and other influenza viruses infecting, or with the potential to infect, humans including seasonal influenza.

"2009","http://www.who.int/csr/don/2009_12_11a/en/index.html"," Pandemic (H1N1) 2009 - update 78  Weekly update   11 December 2009 -  As of 6 December 2009, worldwide more than 208 countries and overseas territories or communities have reported laboratory confirmed cases of pandemic influenza H1N1 2009, including at least 9596 deaths.   As many countries have stopped counting individual cases, particularly of milder illness, the case count is likely to be significantly lower than the actual number of cases that have occurred. WHO is actively monitoring the progress of the pandemic through frequent consultations with the WHO Regional Offices and member states and through monitoring of multiple sources of data.  Situation update:   In the temperate zone* of the northern hemisphere, pandemic influenza activity has passed its peak in North America and in parts of western, northern, and eastern Europe, but activity continues to increase in parts of central and southeastern Europe, as well as in south and east Asia. Influenza transmission remains active in much of western and central Asia and there is evidence of pandemic virus circulation in most regions of Africa.   In United States and Canada, active influenza virus transmission persists but overall ILI** activity continues to decline for the 5th and 3rd consecutive weeks, respectively. In the US, after 8 weeks of increases, proportional mortality due to pneumonia and influenza (P&I mortality) has begun to decrease but remains elevated above the epidemic threshold; weekly numbers of lab-confirmed hospitalizations and deaths have also recently begun to decline. So far, comparing transmission during the current winter season to transmission during the summer season, there appears to be 2-3 times more hospitalized cases and deaths in the United States and approximately 4-5 times more hospitalized cases and deaths in Canada during the winter season. However, the overall rate of hospitalization and death in the population is similar to that which was observed in temperate countries of the southern hemisphere during their winter.  This would indicate that transmission of the virus has been much more widespread and intense during the winter, as predicted, but overall rates of severe illness have not changed compared to southern hemisphere.  Similar to seasonal influenza, persons with certain underlying conditions (compared to those without) were at significantly increased risk of hospitalization and death associated with pandemic H1N1 2009 virus infection. During the current winter season in Canada, 52% of hospitalized cases, 60% of cases requiring ICU, and 67% of fatal cases, had a underlying chronic medical illness. Similar to the experience of many countries, the most common underlying conditions among fatal cases in Canada were asthma followed by chronic cardiac disease, immunosuppression, and diabetes.   In Europe, geographically widespread transmission of pandemic influenza virus continued to be observed across the continent. With the exception of France where ILI activity continues to increase, ILI activity has peaked or passed its peak in much of western Europe, including in Belgium, Iceland, Ireland, Netherlands, Spain, Portugal, Italy, and Germany. In northern Europe, intensity remains high, however activity has begun to decline in Norway, Sweden, and Denmark. Increasing activity continues to be observed in parts of central and southeastern Europe, including in Albania, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Greece, Hungary, Latvia, Poland, Romania, Montenegro, Slovenia, and Turkey. Further east, declining rates of ILI or ARI have been observed in Georgia, Bulgaria, and Ukraine. In the Russian Federation, influenza virus circulation remains active, but overall activity may have recently peaked. A high intensity of respiratory diseases activity was reported in Lithuania and Greece, and a moderate impact on the healthcare system was reported in France and in parts of northern and far eastern Europe. 99% of subtyped influenza A viruses in Europe were pandemic H1N1 2009. Of note, detections of RSV in Europe have increased over the past four weeks which may partially account for elevated ILI activity among young children.   In Western and Central Asia, influenza virus transmission remains active. ILI/ARI activity continues to increase in Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan, but may have peaked in Afghanistan, Israel, and Oman. Pandemic influenza virus continues to circulate in Iran, Iraq, Jordan, and in much of the surrounding region.   In East Asia, influenza transmission remains variable. Influenza activity continues to increase in Japan and has recently begun to increase in Hong Kong SAR and Chinese Taipei both of which previously experienced a peak of transmission. Elevated but stable ILI activity has been reported in southern China, but declines in activity continue to be observed in northern China and Mongolia.  In South Asia, influenza activity has begun to increase in the north-western parts of India and in Sri Lanka. Small number of seasonal influenza viruses continue to be detected in Asia but in decreasing amounts.   In the tropical region of Central and South America and the Caribbean, influenza transmission remains geographically widespread but overall disease activity has been declining in most areas.   In Africa, limited data suggest that pandemic H1N1 2009 virus continues to be detected from all parts of the continent (except South Africa where the winter season has passed). Pandemic H1N1 2009 virus appears to be the predominant influenza virus circulating in northern and eastern Africa.   In the temperate region of the southern hemisphere, sporadic cases of pandemic influenza have been reported in recent weeks but no sustained local transmission has been observed.

In both Canada and the United States, influenza virus circulation remains active and geographically widespread, however, disease activity appears to have peaked in past 3 to 4 weeks. In the United States, deaths due to pneumonia and influenza (P&I mortality) continued to increase past the epidemic threshold for the past 8 weeks and cumulative rates of hospitalizations for the current influenza season have exceeded rates seen in recent seasons among all age groups except those aged ≥ 65.   In Europe, widespread and intense transmission of pandemic influenza virus continued to be observed across most of the continent. In western and northern Europe the peak of disease activity has passed in Belgium, Iceland, Ireland, Netherlands, Norway and parts of the United Kingdom (Northern Ireland, Wales); activity may be peaking or plateauing in Spain, Portugal, Italy, Sweden and Denmark.

The cases were found through regular yellow fever surveillance in the Sub-Prefecture of Yaloké-Bossembelle, Prefecture of Ombella Mpoko and in the Sub-Prefecture of Bagamongone, Prefecture of La Lobaye.   The index case was reported in the Sub-Prefecture of Yaloké-Bossembelle. He was an 18-year-old man, a cattle breeder. On 6 September, he presented with fever, headache, jaundice and haemorrhagic signs. The patient was hospitalized in the health centre of Yaloke, where he died on 14 September. In the following days, 2 additional cases were reported with the same severe clinical presentation, and both died. In Bagamongone, a small town 20 km from Yaloke, another case was reported during the same period.   Three cases were positive for yellow fever IgM at the National Laboratory in the Institute Pasteur of Bangui. The regional reference laboratory at Institut Pasteur in Dakar, Senegal, also confirmed that neutralization tests found specific antibodies against yellow fever, thus confirming the cases to be yellow fever. Other haemorrhagic fevers were excluded by specific tests. During the outbreak investigation conducted by the Ministry of Health, serum samples were collected from 80 of  contacts  of the cases. All these serum samples were sent to the Institute Pasteur of Bangui for investigation, and were IgM negative by ELISA test. Entomological studies showed a limited presence of mosquito vectors of sylvatic yellow fever.   These cases follow two yellow fever outbreaks in Basse Kotto and Ombella Mpoko Prefectures earlier in 2009. In 2008, 4 reported events resulted in reactive mass vaccination campaigns. Cases had occurred in the sub-prefectures of Bozoum in April 2008, Boda in August 2008, Bimbo and Briac in October 2008. An assessment of yellow fever virus circulation in human, non human primates and vectors was carried out in 2009 by a group of experts of the Yellow Fever Partnership. Laboratory testing for the study is underway.   Emergency mass vaccination against yellow fever is planned for a population of 327,877 in affected regions for early December 2009. Vaccines have been provided from the global emergency vaccine stockpile, managed by the International Coordinating Group for Yellow Fever Vaccine Provision (YF-ICG) with funding from the GAVI Alliance. The Central African Republic is not part of a group of 12 endemic countries in Africa where preventive mass vaccination campaigns are ongoing since 2007. However, with these events since 2008, the Central African Republic is now considered to be at high risk of further outbreaks.  "

Situation update:   The situation remains similar since the last update. In temperate regions* of the northern hemisphere, the early arriving winter influenza season continues to intensify across parts of North America and much of Europe. However, there are early signs of a peak in disease activity in some areas of the northern hemisphere.   In the United States, influenza transmission remains active and geographically widespread, although disease activity appears to have recently peaked in most areas except in the northeastern United States. In Canada, influenza transmission continues to intensify without a clear peak in activity; the ILI consultation rate, which has been highest among children aged 5-19, continues to significantly exceed mean rates observed over the past 12 influenza seasons.   In Europe, widespread and increasing transmission of pandemic influenza virus was observed across much of the continent but the most intense circulation of virus occurred in northern, eastern, and southeastern Europe. Transmission appears to have peaked in few countries of Western Europe including Iceland, Ireland, the UK (Northern Ireland), and Belgium after a period of sustained intense transmission. Further east, a number of countries reported sharp increases in the rates of ILI** (Serbia, Moldova, Norway, Lithuania, Georgia) or ARI (Belarus, Bulgaria, Romania, and Ukraine). A moderate or greater impact on the healthcare system was reported in parts of northern and southeastern Europe. Greater than 20% of all sentinel respiratory specimens tested positive for influenza in at least 20 countries, with ≥ 50% of samples testing positive for influenza in Spain, Portugal, Estonia, Slovenia, Slovakia, Moldova, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Greece, Norway, Finland, Denmark, Belgium, Iceland, and Ireland. Over 99% of subtyped influenza A viruses in the Europe were pandemic H1N1 2009.   In Central and Western Asia, increasing diseases activity and pandemic influenza virus isolations continues to be reported in several countries. A high intensity of respiratory diseases with increasing trend was reported in Kazakhstan. Recent increases in rates of ILI or ARI have been observed in Uzbekistan and in parts of Afghanistan (particularly in the capital region and in southern and northeastern provinces). In Israel, sharp increases in rates of ILI and pandemic virus detections have been reported in recent weeks.   In East Asia, influenza transmission remains active. Intense influenza activity continues to be observed in Mongolia with a severe impact on the healthcare system; however, disease activity may have recently peaked in the past 1-2 weeks. In Japan, influenza activity remains elevated but stable nationally, and may be decreasing slightly in populated urban areas.  A small number of seasonal H3N2 and H1N1 influenza viruses continue to be detected in China and South East Asia, though the proportion of seasonal viruses is declining in relation to the proportion of pandemic influenza H1N1.   In tropical zone of the Americas and Asia, the intensity of influenza transmission is variable. In the tropical areas of Central and South America, most countries continue to report declining influenza activity, with the exception of Peru and Colombia. In the Caribbean Epidemiology Centre (CAREC) countries, after a recent peak of disease activity, rates of ARI have declined over the past 3-4 weeks. With the exception of Sri Lanka, overall transmission continues to decline in most parts of tropical South and Southeast Asia. In Hong Kong SAR, rates of ILI have returned baseline after a recent wave of predominantly pandemic H1N1 influenza in September and October.   In the temperate region of the southern hemisphere, little pandemic influenza activity has been reported.

The World Health Organization (WHO) is working closely with the government of Cape Verde to support technical response to the outbreak, as well as to support coordination with other United Nations agencies, bilateral partners and non-governmental organizations for the operational response.   WHO has deployed more than 20 experts - many through the Global Alert and Response Network (GOARN) mechanism - to support Cape Verde on epidemiological and entomological surveillance and laboratory investigation, vector-control, clinical case management, social mobilization, logistics and information and technology.   The experts come from Senegal, Thailand, Brazil, Italy, Martinique, Guadeloupe, French-Guyana and from within WHO.   WHO has also deployed personal protection equipment (PPE), larvicide, fog machines and laboratory diagnostics supplies to support the government operations for source reduction, vector control and sustaining the onsite laboratory diagnosis of dengue. Dengue technical guidelines in Portuguese have also been provided by WHO.   The Ministry of Health of Cape Verde, the Operational Nucleus of Information Society (NOSi) and WHO have launched a nationwide internet and text messaging (SMS) reporting and alert system for dengue, providing real time information to public health experts and alerting individuals at risk when and how to seek care.   This is the first dengue outbreak in the country and people did not have immunity against the disease. During epidemics of dengue, infection rates among those who have not been previously exposed to the virus are often between 40% and 50%, but could reach 80% to 90% in worse case scenario.   Dengue is present in sub-Saharan Africa but often unrecognized. Although many arboviruses – such as dengue, chikungunya, Crimean–Congo haemorrhagic fever, Rift Valley fever, yellow fever and West Nile virus – affect human health in west Africa, surveillance programmes are not consistently available except for yellow fever.   In the recent years, dengue has been documented in travellers returning from several countries in West Africa, and particularly dengue type-3 virus. Dengue type-3 virus has first isolated in travellers returning to Japan and France from Abidjan Cote d’Ivoire in 2008 and from Senegal to Italy in October 2009.

Analyses are being performed by two WHO influenza collaborating centres as part of the global influenza surveillance network.   Preliminary genetic sequencing shows that the virus is similar to the virus used for production of the pandemic influenza vaccine, reconfirming the vaccine's efficacy at this time.   Additional questions about the pandemic virus circulating in Ukraine will be answered as more data is available.   WHO commends the government of Ukraine for its open sharing of samples to inform global monitoring of the virus for signs of change.   A total of 34 samples were analysed independently by the WHO Collaborating Centre for Reference and Research on Influenza, Mill Hill in London, UK, and the WHO Collaborating Centre for the Surveillance, Epidemiology and Control of Influenza in Atlanta, Georgia, USA.

As many countries have stopped counting individual cases, particularly of milder illness, the case count is likely to be significantly lower than the actual number of cases that have occurred. WHO is actively monitoring the progress of the pandemic through frequent consultations with the WHO Regional Offices and member states and through monitoring of multiple sources of data.  Situation update:   The winter influenza season, which began unusually early across much of the Northern Hemisphere, shows early signs of peaking in parts of North America but is intensifying across much of Europe and Central and Eastern Asia.   In North America, Canada reported sharp increases in rates of influenza-like-illness (ILI), detections of pandemic H1N1 virus, and school outbreaks over the past three weeks as pandemic activity continues to spread west to east. In the United States, influenza transmission remains geographically widespread and intense but largely unchanged since the previous reporting week; rates of hospitalizations among persons aged 0-4 years, 5-17 years, and 18-49 years have now exceeded those seen during recent previous influenza seasons. Disease activity may have peaked in the earlier affected southern and south eastern parts of the United States. In Mexico, influenza activity remains geographically widespread with a significant wave of cases reported since early September, most notably from central and southern Mexico.   In Europe and Central Asia, overall influenza transmission continues to intensify throughout the continent as pandemic activity spreads eastward. At least 10 countries of Western Europe (Iceland, Poland, Romania, Belgium, Germany, the Netherlands, Norway, Spain, Sweden and the United Kingdom) now report that the proportion of sentinel samples testing positive for influenza exceeded 20% consistent with active circulation of pandemic influenza viruses. High to very high intensity of respiratory diseases with concurrent circulation of pandemic H1N1 2009 was also reported in the Netherlands, Italy, much of Northern Europe, Belarus, Bulgaria, and in the Russian Federation (particularly in the Urals). Disease activity may be peaking in a few countries, notably Iceland, Ireland, and parts of the UK (Northern Ireland) that experienced intense transmission during early autumn.  Because of a sharp rise in pandemic influenza cases one week ago in Ukraine, the Ministry of Health requested assistance from WHO European Regional Office to evaluate and respond.  The initial analysis of information indicates that the numbers of severe cases do not appear to be excessive when compared to the experience of other countries and do not represent any change in the transmission or virulence of the virus.   Over 99% of subtyped influenza A viruses in the Europe were pandemic H1N1 2009 with the exception of the Russian Federation where   In Western Asia, increasing activity has been observed in several countries. In Israel, sharp increases in rates of ILI and pandemic virus detections have been observed over the past 3 weeks. In Afghanistan, the proportion of sentinel visits for acute respiratory infections (ARI) has increased over the past 3-4 weeks, but more dramatically in the last 1-2 weeks.   In East Asia, very intense and increasing influenza activity continues to be reported in Mongolia with a severe impact on the healthcare system. In China, the proportion of sentinel hospital visits for ILI and the proportions of respiratory samples testing positive for influenza, continued to increase over the past 3-4 weeks. More than 80% of influenza viruses isolated in China were pandemic H1N1 2009. In Hong Kong SAR, rates of ILI have returned baseline after a recent wave of predominantly pandemic H1N1 influenza in September and October. In Japan, sharp increases in influenza activity continue to be reported nationally. On northern island of Hokkaido, which to date has been the most heavily affected, disease activity may have recently peaked.   Although active, predominantly pandemic influenza transmission persists in the Caribbean region, disease activity may have recently peaked in some places as evidenced by recently declining rates of ARI and severe acute respiratory infections (SARI) in the Caribbean Epidemiology Centre (CAREC) countries. Most other countries in the tropical region of Central and South America continue to report declining influenza activity.   With the exception of Nepal and Sri Lanka, overall transmission continues to decline in most parts of South and Southeast Asia.   In the temperate region of the southern hemisphere, little pandemic influenza activity has been reported in recent weeks. Of note, a cluster of pandemic influenza cases been reported in Argentina in the capital area.

As many countries have stopped counting individual cases, particularly of milder illness, the case count is likely to be significantly lower than the actual number of cases that have occurred. WHO is actively monitoring the progress of the pandemic through frequent consultations with the WHO Regional Offices and member states and through monitoring of multiple sources of data.  Situation update:   Intense and persistent influenza transmission continues to be reported in North America without evidence of a peak in activity. The proportion of sentinel physician visits due to influenza-like-illness (ILI)(8%) has exceeded levels seen over the past 6 influenza seasons; 42% of respiratory samples tested were positive for influenza and 100% of subtyped influenza A viruses were pandemic H1N1 2009. Rates of ILI, proportions of respiratory samples testing positive for influenza, and numbers of outbreaks in educational settings continues to increase sharply in Canada as activity spreads eastward. Significantly more cases of pandemic H1N1 have been recorded in Mexico since September than were observed during the initial springtime epidemic.   In Europe and Central and Western Asia, pandemic influenza activity continues to increase across many countries, signalling an unusually early start to the winter influenza season. Active circulation of virus marked by high proportions of sentinel respiratory samples testing positive for influenza has been reported in Belgium (69%), Ireland (55%), Netherlands (51%), Norway (66%), Spain (46%), Sweden (33%), the United Kingdom (Northern Ireland:81%), and Germany (27%). In addition, there is evidence of increasing and active transmission of pandemic influenza virus across Northern and Eastern Europe (including Ukraine and Belarus), and eastern Russia. For details on the situation in Ukraine please refer to the Disease Outbreak News update below.  In Western Asia and the Eastern Mediterranean Region, increasing activity has been reported in Oman and Afghanistan.   Pandemic (H1N1) 2009, Ukraine -  update 1    In East Asia, intense and increasing influenza activity continues to be reported in Mongolia. In China, after an earlier wave of mixed influenza activity (seasonal H3N2 and pandemic H1N1), pandemic H1N1 influenza activity now predominates and is increasing. Sharp increases in pandemic influenza activity continue to be reported throughout Japan with highest rates of illness being reported on the northern island.   Active influenza transmission and increasing levels of respiratory diseases continues to be reported in parts of the Caribbean, including in Cuba, Haiti, and other Caribbean Epidemiology Centre (CAREC) countries. Most other countries in the tropical region of Central and South America continue to report declining influenza activity. With the exception of Nepal, Sri Lanka, and Cambodia, overall transmission continues to decline in most but not all parts of tropical South and Southeast Asia.  Influenza virus isolates from sub-Saharan Africa are predominantly pandemic H1N1 virus but some seasonal H3N2 has been detected even in recent weeks.  Unconfirmed media reports from the area indicate that disease activity has increased in recent weeks.   Since the new pandemic H1N1 2009 virus emerged, infections in different species of susceptible animals (pig, turkey, ferret, and cat) have been reported. Limited evidence suggests that these infections occurred following direct transmission of the virus from infected humans. These isolated events have had no impact on the dynamics of the pandemic, which is spreading readily via human-to-human transmission. As human infections become increasingly widespread, transmission of the virus from humans to other animals is likely to occur with greater frequency. Unless the epidemiology of the pandemic changes, these will continue to pose no special risks to human health.

"2009","http://www.who.int/csr/don/2009_11_03/en/index.html"," Pandemic (H1N1) 2009, Ukraine -  update 1   3 November 2009 -  According to the Ministry of Health of Ukraine, the country has now recorded more than 250 000 cases of influenza-like illness, with 235 patients requiring intensive care. As of 2 November, 70 deaths from acute respiratory illness have been reported.   Regions in western Ukraine continue to show the highest rates of acute respiratory illness/influenza-like illness. The level of activity in the Kyiv area is also increasing rapidly.   Laboratory testing in Ukraine has confirmed pandemic H1N1 influenza virus in samples taken from patients in two of the most affected regions. As the pandemic virus has rapidly become the dominant influenza strain worldwide, it can be assumed that most cases of influenza in Ukraine are caused by the H1N1 virus.   As elsewhere, WHO strongly recommends early treatment with the antiviral drugs, oseltamivir or zanamivir, for patients who meet treatment criteria, even in the absence of a positive laboratory test confirming H1N1 infection.   At the request of the government, a multi-disciplinary team of nine experts has been deployed by WHO and arrived in Kyiv yesterday evening. Discussions with the Minister of Health were held this morning to brief the team.   Team members will now begin field investigations to characterize the clinical and epidemiological features of the outbreak. Work will initially begin in Lviv region, where reported numbers of cases showing severe manifestations of acute respiratory illness have been especially high. Two virologists on the team have started working at the National Influenza Centre and the laboratories of the Central Sanitary and Epidemiological Station in Kyiv to provide diagnostic support.   Samples sent by the Ministry of Health were received today by the WHO Collaborating Centre for Reference and Research on Influenza, Mill Hill in London, UK. The laboratory will conduct confirmatory tests and further characterize the virus.   Many questions remain to be answered. The outbreak in Ukraine may be indicative of how the virus can behave in the northern hemisphere during the winter season, particularly in health care settings typically found in Eastern Europe.   Given the potential significance of this outbreak as an early warning signal, WHO commends the government of Ukraine for its transparent reporting and open sharing of samples.   WHO continues to recommend no closing of borders and no restrictions on international travel, including to Ukraine. Experience shows that such measures will not stop further spread of the virus.  "
"2009","http://www.who.int/csr/don/2009_11_01/en/index.html"," Pandemic (H1N1) 2009, Ukraine   On 28 October 2009, the Ministry of Health of Ukraine informed WHO, through its Country Office in Ukraine, about an unusually high level of activity of acute respiratory illness in the western part of the country, associated with an increased number of hospital admissions and fatalities.   On 30 October 2009, the Ministry of Health of Ukraine announced the confirmation of pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus infection by RT-PCR in eleven out of 30 samples obtained from patients presenting with acute respiratory illness in two of the most affected regions.  Tests were performed in two laboratories in Kyiv, including the National Influenza Centre.  Confirmatory tests will be performed at one of the WHO Collaborating Centres for Influenza.   The situation is quickly changing with increasingly high levels of acute respiratory illness (ARI)/Influenza-like-illness (ILI) activity being observed in Ternopil, Lviv, Ivano-Frankivsk, and Chernivtsi regions.  The higher levels of transmission in these regions corresponds to an increased number of hospital admissions and fatalities associated with severe manifestations of acute respiratory illness.   As of 30 October 2009, over 2,300 individuals have been admitted to hospital, including over 1,100 children. One hundred and thirty one (131) cases have required intensive care, including 32 children.  As of 31 October 2009, a total of 38 fatalities associated with severe manifestations of ARI have been registered.  Preliminary epidemiological data analysis indicates that severe cases and deaths primarily occur among previously healthy young adults aged 20 – 50 years. Fatal and severe cases are reported to have sought medical attention 5 to 7 days after onset of symptoms.   International experience of the (H1N1) 2009 pandemic to date, especially from the Southern Hemisphere, has shown that poor clinical outcomes are associated with delays in seeking health care and limited access to supportive care.  In addition, this virus has also shown its ability to cause rapidly progressive overwhelming lung disease which is very difficult to treat.   Public health measures recommended by the Ministry of Health of Ukraine across the entire country include: social distancing (school closures and cancellation of mass gatherings); enhancement of surveillance activities; increased respiratory hygiene; and continuation of the vaccination campaign against seasonal influenza targeting at risk groups.   The Government of the Ukraine has activated coordination mechanisms to respond to the rapidly evolving situation, including the harmonization of response plans across all administrative levels.   In response to the request from the Minister of Health of Ukraine, WHO is deploying a multi-disciplinary team of experts to assist national authorities in mitigating the impact of the pandemic.  The team comprises of the following expertise: health emergencies coordination, case management, epidemiology, laboratory diagnostics, logistics, and media/risk communications.   As per WHO's communication in May 2009, there is no rationale for travel restrictions because such measures will not prevent the spread of the disease.   Travellers can protect themselves and others by following simple recommendations aimed at preventing the spread of infection such as attention to respiratory hygiene. Individuals who are ill should delay travel plans and returning travellers who fall ill should seek appropriate medical care. These recommendations are prudent measures which can limit the spread of many communicable diseases and not only the pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus.  "

The first samples tested, have been laboratory confirmed as dengue virus serotype 3 by the Institute Pasteur Dakar, the WHO Collaborating Centre for Arbovirus and Viral Haemorrhagic Fevers (VHF) and Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network (GOARN) partner.   This is the first reported epidemic of Dengue fever in Cape Verde.   It is important to highlight that an ongoing outbreak of Pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus has been circulating in the country since June 2009.   The Government has established a ministerial committee of vector control lead by the Prime Minister including all ministries involved in containing the outbreak.  The measures taken include clinical management, vector control, and social mobilization. A rapid surveillance and reporting system through SMS messaging systems has been established by the MoH and the public IT agency with WHO collaboration.   On 26 October a team from the WHO Regional Office for Africa, Intercountry Support Team and the Institute Pasteur Dakar arrived to support Cape Verde in investigating the outbreak. The team will provide laboratory, entomology and epidemiology support and set up laboratory diagnostics at the Hospital Agostinho Neto.

Situation update : In general, influenza activity in the northern hemisphere is much the same as in the last week, though respiratory disease activity continues to spread and increase in intensity.  In North America, the U.S.A. is still reporting nationwide rates of Influenza-Like Illness (ILI) well above baseline rates with high rates of pandemic H1N1 2009 virus detections in clinical laboratory specimens (29% of all specimens tested are positive for influenza A and all of those subtyped are pandemic H1N1 2009 virus.  Canada reports increases in ILI rates for the fourth straight week but the highest level of activity is in the western province of British Columbia. Mexico still reports active transmission in some areas of the country.  Although influenza activity is low in most countries in Europe, in Belgium, Israel, the Netherlands, Norway, and parts of the United Kingdom consultation ILI/ARI rates are above baseline levels. Similarly the number of influenza virus detections relatively high, which may indicate the early start of an influenza season. Rates of respiratory illness in Eastern Europe and Northern Asia are increasing but are not yet at levels normally seen in an influenza season (baseline levels are not defined in many countries of the area).  Of note, the proportion of cases in Asia that are related to seasonal influenza A(H3N2) continue to decline globally as the proportion related to pandemic H1N1 2009 virus increases.  Currently, only East Asia is reporting any significant numbers of influenza A(H3N2) isolates. In tropical areas of the world, rates of illness are generally declining, with a few exceptions.

"2009","http://www.who.int/csr/don/2009_10_16/en/index.html"," Pandemic (H1N1) 2009 - update 70  Weekly update   As of 11 October 2009, worldwide there have been more than 399232 laboratory confirmed cases of pandemic influenza H1N1 2009 and over 4735 deaths reported to WHO.   As many countries have stopped counting individual cases, particularly of milder illness, the case count is significantly lower than the actually number of cases that have occurred. WHO is actively monitoring the progress of the pandemic through frequent consultations with the WHO Regional Offices and member states and through monitoring of multiple sources of data. Influenza activity continues to increase in the northern temperate zones across the world.  In North America, the United States is now experiencing nationwide rates of Influenza-Like Illness (ILI) well above seasonal baseline rates with high rates of pandemic H1N1 2009 virus detections in clinical laboratory specimens.  Canada is reporting increases in ILI rates for the third straight week with some provinces now crossing the baseline. Mexico also reports high intensity and active transmission in some areas of the country.  Western Europe and northern Asia are experiencing increased rates of ILI, well above baseline in some countries but activity is generally not as widespread as in North America. Of note, nearly half of the influenza viruses detected in China are seasonal influenza A (H3N2) viruses, which appeared prior to and is co-circulating with pandemic H1N1 2009 virus. The tropical zones continue to have transmission that is mixed as some countries have now peaked and are declining, while others are experiencing increases.  In the tropical region of the Americas, several Caribbean Island nations are now reporting increased rates of illness while Brazil, Costa Rica and other countries on the continent are declining.  In South Asia, most countries now report a decline in rates of illness. Influenza rates in the temperate zones of the Southern Hemisphere have all returned to below baseline levels and very few detections of pandemic H1N1 2009 virus are being reported. Three articles of interest published this week in the peer reviewed literature reported three different series of seriously ill pandemic influenza patients in Canada, Mexico, Australia, and New Zealand.  Several important observations were made including: •A significant portion of patients with severe disease requiring intensive care had no predisposing conditions.  The numbers are not directly comparable as the studies categorized conditions differently but nearly 1/3 of ICU patients in Australia and New Zealand had no predisposing conditions.  98% of ICU cases in Canada had a comorbid condition, which in this report included hypertension, smoking, and substance abuse, but only 30% had comorbid conditions that were considered  major .  In Mexico, 84% of critical patients had an underlying condition, which in the report included hypertension, ever having smoked, and hyperlipidemia, conditions that are not considered risk factors for severe influenza outcomes.  All three groups were impressed by the number of severe cases occurring in previously healthy individuals. •The researchers in Australia and New Zealand reaffirmed that infants under the age of 1 year have the highest risk of developing severe illness. The average age of ICU patients was 32, 40, and 44 years in Canada, Australia/New Zealand, and Mexico respectively. •The study from Australia and New Zealand estimated that the demand for ICU beds due to viral pneumonia during the pandemic was as much higher than in previous influenza seasons.  The Canadian study reported that intensive care capacity in Winnipeg, Manitoba, was  seriously challenged  at the peak of the outbreak with full occupancy of all regional ICU beds.

As many countries have stopped counting individual cases, particularly of milder illness, the case count is significantly lower than the actually number of cases that have occurred. WHO is actively monitoring the progress of the pandemic through frequent consultations with the WHO Regional Offices and member states and through monitoring of multiple sources of data. In the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere, transmission of influenza virus and rates of influenza-like-illness (ILI) continue to increase marking an unusually early start to fall and winter influenza season in many countries. Geographically widespread influenza is being reported throughout North America, with the United States reporting ILI levels elevated above the seasonal baseline for the past month and Mexico reporting a high intensity of respiratory diseases for the past three weeks. In Canada, although overall ILI activity remains low, focal increases have been reported in the western part of Canada. In Europe and Central and Western Asia, early transmission of influenza virus continues to increase in many countries, with more intense focal activity being reported in a few. National or regional ILI levels remained elevated above the baseline in parts of the United Kingdom (Northern Ireland and Scotland), Ireland, and Israel. In Ireland, a high intensity of respiratory diseases has been reported for the past two weeks, with the highest rates of ILI reported among children aged 5-14 years old. In addition to Ireland and Israel, widespread geographic spread of influenza virus is also now being reported in Belgium, the Netherlands, and Cyprus. At least 10 countries in the region are also reporting an increasing trend in respiratory diseases activity. In Japan, influenza activity continues to be elevated above the seasonal epidemic threshold since week 33, most recently in the large population centers. In the tropical regions of the Americas and Asia, influenza virus transmission persists, however influenza activity remained variable. Geographically widespread to regional influenza activity continues to be reported throughout the tropical region of the Americas without a consistent overall trend (and increasing trend in parts of the Caribbean, and decreasing in much of tropical Central and South America). High intensity respiratory diseases activity was reported in Columbia, Cuba, and El Salvador, and moderate healthcare impact was experienced in many countries; two countries, Barbados and St. Lucia, reported severe healthcare impact. As influenza transmission slowly declines in many parts of South and Southeast Asia, several countries are reporting geographically regional spread (India, Bangladesh, and Thailand) or localized spread (Sri Lanka and Myanmar) of influenza activity; and most countries in the region have reported experiencing a low health care impact since late September. In the temperate regions of the southern hemisphere, influenza transmission has largely subsided (Chile, Argentina, and New Zealand) or continues to decline substantially (South Africa and Australia).

The index case is from Kotto 1 - Bomboko village,  Buea Health District, South-West Province. A reactive mass vaccination campaign is planned for October 2009 in two districts, Buea and Mbongue, with a  target population of 165,138.   The patient is a 61 year-old man male, without history of yellow fever vaccination, who presented with fever, jaundice and back pain with onset of symptoms on 27 July 2009. The patient consulted a private practitioner in Buea Health District and a clinical diagnosis of yellow fever was made.   Preliminary testing at the Institut Pasteur of Yaoundé suggested the patient may have yellow fever, a finding confirmed by the regional reference laboratory at the Institut Pasteur in Dakar, Senegal, where tests for other haemorrhagic fevers were negative.   During the outbreak investigation, 51 serum samples were collected from additional suspected cases. Laboratory analysis of the specimens is ongoing at the Institut Pasteur in Yaoundé. As yellow fever outbreaks have occurred in different parts of Cameroon, the country carried out a national yellow fever preventive vaccination campaign in May 2009, for the population of 62 districts at high risk. The health district of Buea was not previously known to be a yellow fever endemic area. This outbreak response campaign will therefore extend the area protected against future outbreaks.   The country will use vaccine from the global yellow fever vaccine emergency stockpile, which is managed by the International Coordinating Group for Yellow Fever Vaccine Provision (YF-ICG) and funded by the GAVI Alliance.

In North America, the United States has reported continued increases in activity above the seasonal baseline for the last 2 to 3 weeks, primarily in the southeast but now also appearing in the upper midwest and the northeast. In Europe and Central and Western Asia, the United Kingdom is reporting regional increases in ILI activity in Northern Ireland and Scotland and the Netherlands, France, Ireland, and Israel are reporting rates above the seasonal baseline. In In Japan, influenza activity continues to be slightly above the seasonal epidemic threshold.  The increases in ILI activity have been accompanied by increases in laboratory isolations of pandemic influenza H1N1 2009 in most of these areas. In the tropical regions of the Americas and Asia, influenza activity remains variable. In parts of India, Bangladesh and Cambodia, influenza transmission continues to be active, while other countries in the Southeast Asia have been recently reporting declining transmission (Indonesia, Singapore and Thailand). Although most countries in the tropical regions of the Americas are still reporting regional to widespread geographic spread of influenza activity, there is no consistent pattern in the trend of respiratory diseases. Peru and Mexico have reported an increasing trend in some areas, while most others are reporting an unchanged or decreasing trend (most notably Bolivia, Venezuela and Brazil).

Many countries in the region are reporting increasing or sustained high levels of respiratory disease, and a few (Thailand and Brunei Darussalam) have begun to report a declining trend in the level of respiratory diseases.   In tropical regions of Central America and the Caribbean (represented by countries such as Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Panama, and Cuba), influenza activity continues to be geographically regional or widespread, however, most are now reporting a declining trend in the level of respiratory diseases. Countries in the equatorial and tropical regions of South America (represented by Ecuador, Venzezuela, Peru, and parts of Brazil) continue to experience geographically regional or widespread influenza activity, with many reporting an increasing trend in the level of respiratory diseases. Although many countries in temperate regions of the southern hemisphere (Chile, Argentina, Australia, and New Zealand) have passed the peak of their winter influenza epidemic, sustained influenza activity continues to be reported in South Africa and in the Southern and Western parts of Australia. In temperate regions of the northern hemisphere, there are wide geographical variations in the level of influenza activity being reported. In Japan, influenza activity continues to increase past the seasonal epidemic threshold, indicating an early beginning to the to annual influenza season. In Canada and the United States, influenza activity remain low overall, however regional increases are being detected in the Southeastern United States. In Europe and Central and Western Asia, although little influenza activity is being reported, a few countries are reporting geographically widespread influenza activity (Israel) or an increasing trend in respiratory diseases (Netherlands and Romania).

As more and more countries have stopped counting individual cases, particularly of milder illness, the case number is significantly lower than the actually number of cases that have occurred.  However, through the WHO monitoring network, it is apparent that rates of influenza illness continue to decline in the temperate regions of the southern hemisphere, except in South Africa where pandemic influenza H1N1 appeared slightly later than the other countries of the region.  Active transmission is still seen in some later affected areas of Australia, Chile and Argentina even as national rates decrease. Areas of tropical Asia are reporting increasing rates of illness as they enter their monsoon season, as represented by India, Thailand, Malaysia, and Hong Kong, four places in the region which have active surveillance programs. Tropical regions of Central America, represented by Costa Rica and El Salvador, are also seeing very active transmission. In the northern temperate zones, overall rates are declining in both North America and Europe though the virus is still found across a wide area throughout both regions and pockets of high activity are being reported in 3 U.S. states and a few countries of Western Europe. It has been noted throughout the temperate zones of the southern hemisphere, which are now passing out of their winter season, that when pandemic H1N1 began to circulate, the relative importance of seasonal strains, represented by H3N2 in nearly all countries, rapidly diminished and pandemic H1N1 became the dominant strain.  Some seasonal H1N1 strains were reported but were even less common than seasonal H3N2.  It is too early to tell if this co-circulation of multiple strains will continue into the coming season of the Northern Hemisphere but it appears very likely that pandemic H1N1 will be the dominant influenza virus in the early part of the winter months. Many countries including Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and the U.S. have noted that their indigenous peoples appear to be at increased risk of severe disease related to pandemic influenza.   While it still has not been clearly determined how much of the increased risk observed in these groups is due to issues related to access to care, high rates of chronic medical conditions that are known to increase risk, or other factors, countries with indigenous and other vulnerable populations should carefully evaluate the situation and consider ways to mitigate the impact of the pandemic in the coming season in these populations. WHO has also been notified of 12 cases of oseltamivir resistant virus.  These isolates have a mutation in the neuraminidase (referred to as H275Y) that confers resistance to oseltamivir, though the viruses remain sensitive to zanamivir.  Of these 8 have been associated with oseltamivir post exposure prophylaxis, one with treatment of uncomplicated illness, and two have been from immunocompromised patients receiving oseltamivir treatment. These isolated cases have arisen in different parts of the world (Japan 4, USA 2, China, Hong Kong SAR China 2, and 1 in Denmark, Canada, Singapore and China), and there are no epidemiological links between them.  There is also no evidence of onward transmission from these cases.  Virology data update as of 8 August 2009   Download update (.pdf)  "

While the case counts no longer reflect actual disease activity, WHO is actively monitoring the progress of the pandemic through frequent consultations with the WHO Regional Offices and member states. Of particular interest is the situation in temperate countries of the Southern Hemisphere, which are now passing through their winter season.  This season, pandemic H1N1 has been the predominant influenza virus in nearly all of the temperate regions of Southern Hemisphere, with South Africa being a notable exception.  Australia and countries in the southern part of South America experienced rapid increases in cases of pandemic influenza early in their winter season.  These same areas are now starting to report decreases in the numbers of people seeking care and being admitted to hospital. Although the virus is still circulating in these areas as it moves into areas not affected earlier, the overall national trends are downward.  South Africa, in contrast, experienced an early influenza season with a seasonal subtype, influenza A (H3N2).  As the influenza season in South Africa reached its peak in early to mid June and began to decline, pandemic influenza H1N1 appeared and has now become the dominant subtype seen there as well. In the temperate areas of the northern hemisphere which experienced early outbreaks of pandemic H1N1 influenza, including countries in North America and Europe, the virus continues to spread to new areas and cause intense local outbreaks.  However, the overall national trend in cases is downward in the Americas. Tropical regions of the world, which typically experience year round transmission of influenza viruses with peak transmission at different and often multiple times in a year, are now seeing increases in cases, for example in tropical areas of Central and South America and in South and South East Asia. In summary, the overall picture of transmission globally is one of declining transmission in the temperate regions of the Southern Hemisphere with the exception of southern Africa.  The season in these areas was characterized by rapid rise and fall of respiratory disease numbers, as is seen in a normal influenza season.  The impact and severity of the season in these areas in terms of proportion of cases which developed severe disease and the load imposed on health care infrastructure is still being evaluated but generally appeared slightly worse than a normal influenza season in most places with increased hospitalization requiring respiratory critical care.  The northern hemisphere is experiencing continued spread of the virus but declining activity is being observed in areas affected early in the course of the pandemic.  Tropical areas of the world are now experiencing increasing numbers of cases at a time when the usual seasonal peaks would occur.  As the pandemic H1N1 influenza virus is now the dominant strain in most areas of the world, it can be expected to persist into the coming influenza season in the Northern Hemisphere. Additionally, there is a risk of further spread of virus in highly populated areas as community spread starts occurring in Asia and Africa.  "

On 30 July, 11 people who had close contact with the case (mainly relatives who attended the funeral) developed fever and cough, and were all hospitalized.  On 1 August, specimens taken from all these 12 people, including the 1st case, tested positive for plague.   On 2 August both the 64 year old father-in-law of the first case and a 37 year old male neighbour of the first case (who helped to bury the corpse) also died. Of the remaining 9 cases, 1 is in critical condition, 1 had acute symptoms of fever and cough, and 7 are in stable condition.   As of August 6, the local health authority has isolated 332 close contacts for further medical observation, and implemented traffic control around affected area.  Experts on both disease prevention & control and clinical management have been dispatched to Qinghai province. Protective clothes, X-ray machines and other medical equipment have been sent to the affected area. Prevention guidance pamphlets have also been disseminated.   According to the epidemiological investigation, the source of this outbreak was a wild marmot, which had contact with the dog of the index case. Ziketan is in an area of natural plague bacteria circulation amongst animals and at the present time it is the active season for plague transmission amongst animals. No drug resistance of the bacterium has been found so far and the 3 death cases have been attributed largely to delayed treatment.   China has established a national surveillance network for plague, and has prepared necessary supplies in high-risk areas. After this outbreak, special funds, supplies and experts were quickly dispatched to the affected area.  "

"2009","http://www.who.int/csr/don/2009_07_17/en/index.html"," Polio in Nigeria   17 July 2009 -  In 2009, the northern states of Nigeria have experienced a large polio outbreak due to wild poliovirus type 3 (WPV3) with 258 cases, compared to 32 cases for the same period in 2008. WPV3 from northern Nigeria has this year spread internationally to Niger. Since February 2009, there has also been an increasing number of polio cases due to a type 2 circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus (cVDPV2) in northern Nigeria (103 cases to date in 2009 compared to 31 cases for the same period in 2008). Both serotypes are at continued, and in the case of the cVDPV2 increasing, risk of international spread. While the number of cVDPV2 cases is lower than WPV3 cases, circulation of this serotype is of particular international concern as the last case of polio due to a circulating wild poliovirus type 2 (WPV2) was in 1999.   In response to these risks, Nigeria has conducted nationwide polio supplementary immunization activities (SIAs) with monovalent OPV type 3 (mOPV3) in late January 2009 and with trivalent OPV from 30 May to 2 June. Additional SIAs are planned for later in the year, including an SIA with trivalent OPV for August.   To minimize the risk and consequences of international spread of these polioviruses, countries across west and central Africa, particularly those bordering the affected states of northern Nigeria, should enhance surveillance for acute flaccid paralysis (AFP), identify subnational population immunity gaps, and strengthen routine immunization with trivalent OPV. Countries affected by poliovirus importations should continue to supplement routine immunization with large-scale outbreak response activities with the relevant OPV, as per the WHA Resolution WHA59.1.

"2009","http://www.who.int/csr/don/2009_06_09/en/index.html"," Cholera in Zimbabwe - update 4   9 June 2009 -  As of 30 May 2009, 98 424 suspected cases, including 4 276 deaths (Case Fatality Rate of 4.3%) have been reported by the Ministry of Health and Child Welfare (MoHCW) of Zimbabwe since August 2008. Fifty-five out of 62 districts in all 10 provinces have been affected.   The number of cases reported per week has decreased from over 8 000 cases per week at the beginning of February 2009 to about 100 cases per week at the end of May 2009. The weekly Case Fatality Rate has also decreased from its peak of near 6% in January 2009, to 1.5% for the week ending 30 May 2009. In the week ending 30 May 2009, 68 new suspected cases and one death were reported, compared to 140 cases and two deaths during the earlier week.   The cholera epidemic appears to be coming to an end but efforts still need to be maintained, especially in the few districts that continue to report cholera cases. The epidemiological situation should be monitored closely and control measures already put in place should be sustained.   The World Health Organization (WHO) and its Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network (GOARN) partners have been working with the Ministry of Health of the Government of Zimbabwe with cholera control efforts across the country. WHO and GOARN partners include the International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease Research, Bangladesh; Burnet Institute in Australia; the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and Health Protection Agency in the UK; US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention; and the National Board of Health and Welfare, Sweden. Non-governmental organizations such as Médecins sans Frontières, the Red Cross and others have been key in supporting MoHCW in treating patients across the country at a time when many health facilities were not fully functional.

Canada on 2 May reported the identification of the A(H1N1) virus in a swine herd in Alberta. It is highly probable that the pigs were exposed to the virus from a Canadian farm worker recently returned from Mexico, who had exhibited flu-like symptoms and had contact with the pigs. There is no indication of virus adaptation through transfer from human to pigs at this time.   There is no risk of infection from this virus from consumption of well-cooked pork and pork products.

All seven confirmed cases had mild Influenza-Like Illness (ILI), with only one requiring brief hospitalization. No deaths have been reported.   The Government of Mexico has reported three separate events. In the Federal District of Mexico, surveillance began picking up cases of ILI starting 18 March. The number of cases has risen steadily through April and as of 23 April there are now more than 854 cases of pneumonia from the capital. Of those, 59 have died. In San Luis Potosi, in central Mexico, 24 cases of ILI, with three deaths, have been reported. And from Mexicali, near the border with the United States, four cases of ILI, with no deaths, have been reported.   Of the Mexican cases, 18 have been laboratory confirmed in Canada as Swine Influenza A/H1N1, while 12 of those are genetically identical to the Swine Influenza A/H1N1 viruses from California.   The majority of these cases have occurred in otherwise healthy young adults. Influenza normally affects the very young and the very old, but these age groups have not been heavily affected in Mexico.   Because there are human cases associated with an animal influenza virus, and because of the geographical spread of multiple community outbreaks, plus the somewhat unusual age groups affected, these events are of high concern.   The Swine Influenza A/H1N1 viruses characterized in this outbreak have not been previously detected in pigs or humans. The viruses so far characterized have been sensitive to oseltamivir, but resistant to both amantadine and rimantadine.   The World Health Organization has been in constant contact with the health authorities in the United States, Mexico and Canada in order to better understand the risk which these ILI events pose. WHO (and PAHO) is sending missions of experts to Mexico to work with health authorities there. It is helping its Member States to increase field epidemiology activities, laboratory diagnosis and clinical management. Moreover, WHO's partners in the Global Alert and Response Network have been alerted and are ready to assist as requested by the Member States.   WHO acknowledges the United States and Mexico for their proactive reporting and their collaboration with WHO and will continue to work with Member States to further characterize the outbreak.  "

This brings to six, out of a total of 141 people, who have tested positive for Ebola Reston antibodies in the Philippines since testing began in December 2008. All six people who were antibody positive reported occupational exposure to pigs.   The Philippine Department of Health has said that all six people who tested positive appear to be in good health.   Pig-to-human transmission is believed to be the most likely source of infection.   To date, since the first human to develop antibodies against Ebola Reston was reported in 1989, no significant human illness has been reported in association with Ebola Reston infection. However only a very small number of humans with Ebola Reston antibodies have ever been detected, and all were healthy adult males. The threat to human health is likely to be low for healthy adults but is unknown for all other population groups, such as immuno-compromised persons, persons with underlying medical conditions, pregnant women and children. More studies are needed to better understand the public health implications of Ebola Reston in humans and efforts should be made to reduce the risk of human infection.   Ebola Reston virus species belongs to the Ebola genus in the Filovirus family, a genus that comprises other Ebola species that are known to be highly pathogenic for humans. All members of the Filovirus family are only handled in laboratories with the highest level of  biosecurity.   Recent cases in the Philippines mark the first time that Ebola Reston has been found in pigs, and the first time that suspected transmission from pigs to humans has occurred.  "

In the week ending 14 March 2009, 2 076 cases were reported. While this number is still high, it compares to 3 812 cases in the immediately-preceding week and over 8000 cases per week at the beginning of February. The weekly Case Fatality Rate has also decreased from its peak of near 6% in January and, while still too high, stood at 2.3% for the week ending 14 March. While data collection and verification remain a challenge throughout the country with the effect that weekly statistics are not always accurate or complete, the overall trend over the last 2 months is of a decreasing number of cases and deaths.   Moreover, the Case Fatality Rate in Cholera Treatment facilities has decreased to 0.8% in the week of 1-7 March, the last week for which accurate statistics of this measure exist. This is below the acceptable level of 1%. The percentage of deaths occurring in the community, outside of Cholera Treatment facilities, remains high but has declined to 33% from 62%.   As of 17 March, 91 164 cases with 4 037 deaths had been reported since the beginning of the current outbreak in August 2008.   Cases have decreased in all provinces. On the other hand, cases reported are increasing again in and around the capital, Harare.  The risk of the outbreak restarting in those areas of the country is real. The need to remain vigilant and to continue and reinforce the control measures already in place is paramount.   The World Health Organization and its Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network (GOARN) partners have a sizeable team working out of the national Cholera Command and Control Centre ( C4 ) in Harare.  The objective of the cholera control measures in the coming days is to extend the operations of the C4 to Regional and District level. GOARN partners working with the Ministry of Health of the Government of Zimbabwe and WHO include the International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease Research, Bangladesh; Burnet Institute in Australia; the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and Health Protection Agency in the UK; US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention; and the National Board of Health and Welfare, Sweden. Nongovernmental organizations such as Médecins sans Frontières, the Red Cross and others have been key in treating patients across the country at a time when many health facilities were not fully functional.

"2009","http://www.who.int/csr/don/2009_03_02a/en/index.html"," Polio in Sudan – high risk of international spread   2 March 2009 -  The recent expansion of a prolonged outbreak of wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) in Sudan poses a very high risk of further international spread, requiring urgent and immediate outbreak response activities in the affected areas and heightened surveillance in countries at risk. Previously restricted to southern Sudan and western Ethiopia, the outbreak has now spread to Kenya, Uganda and northern Sudan (in Khartoum and Port Sudan).   Of particular concern is the confirmation of the WPV1 in Port Sudan. It is from this area that, from 2004 to 2006, WPV1 spread to re-infect several countries, including Saudi Arabia, Somalia, Yemen and Indonesia, causing outbreaks that resulted in more than 1,200 cases and over US$150 million in international emergency outbreak response costs. Due to the historical international spread of polioviruses from Port Sudan, the new international spread from southern Sudan to Kenya and Uganda, and the suboptimal quality of outbreak response activities in southern Sudan and western Ethiopia (monitoring data indicates that upwards of 30% of children remain un- or under-immunized with ≤3 doses of oral poliovirus vaccine), WHO assesses the risk of further international spread from the Sudan as very high.   Stopping this outbreak requires the full implementation of the international polio outbreak response standards, adopted by the World Health Assembly in May 2006, until transmission has been confirmed to be interrupted.   In northern Sudan, a large-scale supplementary immunization activity (SIA) began on 15 February with additional campaigns planned for 23 March and again in late-April. In southern Sudan, SIAs were held on 13 January and 23 February, with further activities planned for 23 March and late April, following which the onset of the rainy season in May could complicate the logistics of reaching all populations in this already difficult-to-access terrain. Consequently, particular attention is being given to closing the persistent OPV coverage gaps during the upcoming SIAs.   In coordination with the polio campaigns in the Sudan, plans for rapid outbreak response campaigns are being finalized for late March, late April and possibly again in late May in the affected areas of Kenya and Uganda. Genetic sequencing data suggests that the importations into these countries have been rapidly detected, improving the prospects for interrupting transmission in the near term if the campaigns are of sufficiently high quality to reach >90% of children in the affected areas.   It is important that countries across central Africa, the Horn of Africa and the Gulf strengthen surveillance for cases of acute flaccid paralysis (AFP), in order to rapidly detect any new poliovirus importations and facilitate a rapid response. Countries should also analyze routine immunization coverage data to identify any subnational gaps in population immunity to guide catch-up immunization activities and thereby minimize the consequences of any new virus introduction. Priority should be given to areas at high-risk of importations and where OPV3/DPT3 coverage is    For more information   Global Polio Eradication Initiative   "

All 10 provinces are affected. The numbers of cases and deaths reported last week indicate a decrease from the previous week however, this data should be interpreted with caution as the figures are revised as new information becomes available.   The weekly CFR has been decreasing regularly since early January, but was still 3.1% last week, far above the expected level of 1%. About half the deaths continue to be recorded within the community rather than health facilities.   Some 365 Cholera Treatment Centres (CTCs) and Units (CTUs) are reported to be active in all provinces and the CFR reported by these centres has been reduced from 4% in late December to between 1% and 2% over the last 3 weeks.   High numbers of cases are also reported in neighbouring countries, especially South Africa, where the relative strength of the health care system has enabled the CFR to remain below 1%. Other countries where cholera has been reported include Malawi, Mozambique and Zambia, but it must be noted that cholera is endemic in these countries.   A Cholera Command and Control Centre has been set up in the capital, Harare, by WHO, together with MoHCW, and health and water and sanitation partners. The role of the Centre is to provide technical coordination for partners in the areas of epidemiological and laboratory surveillance, case management, social mobilization, logistics and infection control/water and sanitation in treatment centres. An alert and response system has been established with partners and the MoHCW to provide daily reporting of cases and deaths. The system can also provide immediate alerts of new outbreaks. Training sessions on all aspects of cholera control are being organized for partners and MoHCW staff at central and provincial levels.   WHO experts in public health, water and sanitation, logistics and social mobilization have been deployed to outbreak areas from the Country Office in Harare, the Inter-Country Support Team in the sub-region, the African Regional Office and WHO Headquarters. Institutions from the Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network (Burnet Institute in Australia; the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and Health Protection Agency in the UK; the International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease Research, Bangladesh; US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention; and the National Board of Health and Welfare, Sweden) have deployed experts to Zimbabwe to support WHO response efforts. WHO is supplying Diarrheal Disease kits, Emergency Health kits and other medicines.   Given the outbreak's dynamic, in the context of a dilapidated water and sanitation infrastructure and a weak health system, the practical implementation of control measures remains a challenge. Priorities now include decentralizing response activities to the periphery, particularly to areas with no active nongovernmental organizations, and strengthening social mobilization in communities to improve access to health services and earlier treatment. Activities will also focus on resource mobilization and greater involvement of partners in the field.  "

On 30 January 2009  the Government announced that a further four individuals had been found positive for ERV antibodies: two farm workers in Bulacan and one farm worker in Pangasinan - the two farms currently under quarantine in northern Luzon because of ERV infection was found in pigs - and one butcher from a slaughterhouse in Pangasinan. The person announced on 23 January to have tested positive for ERV antibodies is reported to be a backyard pig farmer from Valenzuela City - a neighbourhood within Metro Manila.   The Philippine Department of Health has said that the people who tested positive appear to be in good health and have not suffered from any significant illnesses in the past 12 months. The investigation team reported that it was possible that all 5 individuals had been exposed to the virus as a result of direct contact with sick pigs. The use of personal protective equipment (PPE) is not common practice among these animal handlers.   From these observations and previous studies of ERV, the virus has shown it can be transmitted to humans, without resulting in illness. However, the evidence available relates only to healthy adults and it would be premature to conclude the health effects of the virus on all  population groups. The threat to human health is likely to be low for healthy adults but is unknown for all other population groups, such as immuno-compromised persons, persons with underlying medical conditions, pregnant women and children.   The Philippine Government is conducting contact tracing in relation to the five individuals who tested positive for antibodies. In addition, testing is ongoing for other persons who could have come into contact with sick pigs on the two quarantined farms in the provinces of Bulacan and Pangasinan where pigs co-infected with the Porcine Respiratory and Reproductive Syndrome (PRRS) and ERV were reported in 2008. The two farms remain under quarantine and the Philippine Government is maintaining its voluntary hold of exports of live pigs and fresh and frozen pork meat.   The Philippine Government has announced a combined Department of Health and Department of Agriculture strategy to limit the animal and human health risks of the Ebola Reston Virus and emphasized that local governments, the pig farming industry and the public will play a critical role in the strategy.   Along with its international partners, the WHO will continue to support the Philippine Government in its efforts to gain a better understanding of the Ebola Reston virus, its effects on humans, and the measures that need to be taken to reduce any risks to human health.

The outbreaks in these 20 countries resulted in 1,517 cases, and cost upwards of 500 million US Dollars in international emergency outbreak response funds.   In 2008, northern Nigeria is experiencing an outbreak of wild poliovirus type 1, which has spread internationally into nearby countries in west Africa. Since April 2008, cases due to type 1 polio genetically linked to viruses from northern Nigeria have been detected in Benin, Burkina Faso, Ghana, Niger, Mali and Togo. In 2008, Nigeria accounts for 80% of type 1 polio cases in the world. In addition to international spread of type 1 polio, wild poliovirus type 3 originating from northern Nigeria has also been reported in Chad and Niger.   The risk of additional importations into these west African countries depends fully on the quality of outbreak response activities in Nigeria and the re-infected countries themselves.   In the second half of 2008, Nigeria has conducted large-scale rounds of emergency polio immunization campaigns in the northern states in July and August, as well as in November when oral polio vaccine (OPV) was added to an integrated measles vaccination campaign. Additional nationwide campaigns are planned for late January and again in February.   To minimize the risk of onward spread of polio from Ghana, in particular into Côte d'Ivoire, Ghana has conducted large-scale polio immunization campaigns in October, November and December. The feasibility of conducting preventive campaigns in Côte d'Ivoire is currently being explored. Elsewhere in west Africa, large-scale polio immunization campaigns have been carried out and/or are being planned in Benin, Burkina Faso, Mali, Niger and Togo.   Given these risks, it is important that countries across west Africa strengthen disease surveillance for acute flaccid paralysis (AFP), in order to rapidly detect any poliovirus importations and facilitate a rapid response. Countries should also continue to boost routine immunization coverage against polio to minimize the consequences of any introduction.  For more information   Global Polio Eradication Initiative   "

"2010","http://www.who.int/csr/don/2010_11_13/en/index.html"," Polio in Central Asia and the North Caucasus Federal Region of the Russian Federation   13 November 2010 -  The risk of further international spread of the ongoing polio outbreak in Central Asia and the North Caucasus Federal Region in Russia continues to be high.   In Central Asia, genetic sequencing of the poliovirus isolated from a child paralyzed in Kazakhstan on 12 August 2010 has confirmed ongoing circulation of the virus which caused the Tajikistan outbreak and subsequently spread to the Russian Federation, Turkmenistan and possibly Uzbekistan.  In the Russian Federation, the detection of an additional case of polio with onset on 25 September in the Republic of Dagestan confirms ongoing poliovirus transmission in the North Caucasus Federal Region.   In Tajikistan, the epicenter of the Central Asian outbreak (458 WPV1 cases, at 3 November), no new polio cases have been reported since 4 July 2010 following five mass immunization campaigns with oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV), with a sixth and final round planned for 8-12 November.  In Turkmenistan (three WPV1 cases), no new cases have been reported since 28 June 2010, and four mass OPV immunization campaigns have been completed.  In Kazakhstan, the seven-year-old boy from Saryagach in the Southern Kazakhstan Oblast (SKO) who was paralyzed on 12 August 2010, represents the only case in the country; a second large-scale OPV mop-up round is being conducted in the first week of November.   The Russian Federation's 14th case, the child paralyzed on 25 September, brings the total number of cases in the North Caucasus Federal Region to six, three each from Dagestan and Chechnya. Genetic sequencing of this virus is consistent with ongoing transmission in the North Caucasus Federal Region since the detection of the index cases on 15 July 2010 in Dagestan and 4 August 2010 in Chechnya following two separate importations from Tajikistan.  The other eight cases in Russia represent sporadic importations associated with individual cases, the last of which occurred on 2 July 2010; none of these cases has been associated with ongoing circulation following local catch-up immunization activities with OPV.  In response to the continued transmission in the North Caucasus Federal Region, the Russian Federation initiated a 1st round of mass OPV immunization in the area on 1 November, with a 2nd round planned for late November; both rounds will target all children aged six months to 15 years.   Although Uzbekistan has not confirmed a polio case during the current outbreak in Central Asia, it is not possible to rule out ongoing, undetected transmission in the country because stool samples from acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) cases are not currently being tested in a WHO-accredited laboratory; the bordering areas of Turkmenistan, Kazakhstan and Tajikistan have all reported cases; and, at least one Uzbek national became paralyzed shortly after arrival in Russia which, given the incubation period for paralytic poliomyelitis, suggests infection may have occurred prior to leaving Uzbekistan.  Recognizing the risk of a poliovirus importation and outbreak, Uzbekistan has conducted 4 nationwide OPV campaigns, the last one from 25-31 October.   Countries at risk of poliovirus importation from Central Asia or the North Caucasus Federal Region of the Russian Federation should continue to strengthen surveillance for AFP cases, ensure processing of all specimens at a WHO-accredited poliovirus laboratory, maintain high routine immunization coverage against polio, and conduct supplementary OPV immunization activities as needed to close gaps in population immunity.   As per recommendations in the WHO's International Travel and Health guidelines, travelers to and from polio-affected countries should be fully protected by vaccination. Travelers who have in the past received three or more doses of OPV should be offered another dose of polio vaccine before departure.  Any unimmunized individuals intending to travel to a polio-infected area should have a complete course of polio vaccination. Travelers from polio-affected areas should have a full course of vaccination against polio before leaving, with a minimum one dose of OPV before departure.   WHO's European Regional Office has alerted all Member States to the public health risk posed by the ongoing polio outbreak in Central Asia and the North Caucasus Federal Region of the Russian Federation, as required under the International Health Regulations.   WHO continues to update the European Member States and partners through letters to Ministers, Chief Medical Officers and partners; postings on its European Region website [http://www.euro.who.int/en/what-we-do/health-topics/diseases-and-conditions/poliomyelitis/publications/2010/who-epidemiological-brief-9-polio-outbreak-in-the-european-region-and-country-responses and the www.polioeradication.org website; and through situation reports covering the epidemiology, response actions, and risk assessment.

Four cases have been confirmed to have been caused by wild poliovirus type 1 and laboratory testing continues.  The majority of the reported cases and deaths have occurred in the population aged over 15 years.   Genetic sequencing has determined that the cases are caused by a poliovirus most closely related to that circulating in neighbouring Angola. Congo had recorded its last case of indigenous polio in 2000.   Nearly all cases have been reported from the port city of Pointe Noire, with cases also reported from Niari (5), Bouenza (2), Brazzaville (1), and Kouilou (2).   The Government of Congo has alerted the public to the outbreak and launched an emergency response plan, with support from key partners, including WHO, UNICEF and the US CDC. The first vaccination response, using monovalent oral polio vaccine type 1 (mOPV1), will start on Friday, 12 November, to cover the whole population of Porte Noire and Kouilou, in conjunction with the neighbouring province of Cabinda in Angola. The rest of Congo will be vaccinated starting 18 November using mOPV1. Two additional nationwide rounds are planned. The number, geographic extent and target age groups of further campaigns will be determined by the Government based on the evolving epidemiology. The multi-country campaign may be further expanded to cover additional bordering at-risk areas. New cases continue to be reported.   Countries across central Africa should strengthen surveillance for cases of acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) to rapidly detect any poliovirus importations and facilitate a rapid response.

As just under half of reported deaths so far are taking place in hospitals, but more than half are in the community, PAHO is in the process of mobilizing experts in the area of proper body disposal to travel to Haiti.   WHO's Region for the Americas (PAHO) continues to mobilize international experts including epidemiologists, risk communication, case management, laboratory, water and sanitation, logistics, and LSS/SUMA (humanitarian supply management system) to Haiti and also to the Dominican Republic.   PAHO’s PROMESS (Program on Essential Medicine and Supplies) warehouse currently has stocks of medicines and antibiotics, and PAHO is procuring additional stocks of intravenous fluids and medical supplies.   PAHO is also supporting the Water & Sanitation Cluster in Haiti providing powdered chlorine (including supplies from Brazil) for water purification and testing water that is being distributed to settlement camps. PAHO is also making special efforts to ensure clean water in hospitals.   While no cases of cholera have been reported in Dominican Republican, the outbreak has prompted the Government to mobilize a contingency plan in the border area.   PAHO’s Caribbean Epidemiology Center (CAREC) located in Trinidad is helping Caribbean ministries of health to mobilize and be prepared for any potential cases in the other islands.   PAHO continues to coordinate these efforts with other UN agencies, and with health officials in the USA and Canada. Relief efforts continue as the government, MINUSTAH (the United Nations Stabilization Force in Haiti), UN agencies and NGOs are continuing to provide assistance in a growing number of locations.

In addition, over 1500 laboratory-confirmed cases of dengue fever including 15 deaths have also been reported from Pakistan so far.   Both CCHF and dengue fever are endemic in Pakistan with seasonal rise in cases.  However, recently, the transmission of both CCHF and dengue fever has intensified in the country with increased incidence and geographic expansion.  The recent Pakistan floods may have contributed to this upsurge as a result of changes in risk factors for these diseases.  Operational response   The MoH has scaled up response activities to prevent and mitigate CCHF and dengue fever, including awareness-raising campaigns on exposure risks and preventive measures for the general public, strengthening clinical and case management of patients with haemorrhagic fevers, stockpiling appropriate drugs and personal protective equipment, and implementing targeted vector control activities.   Upon request from the MoH in Pakistan, WHO is mobilizing experts in the clinical management of severe dengue fever and in infection control in health care settings through the Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network (GOARN).

As of 3 October, 40 468 cases and 1 879 deaths have been reported in four countries (Cameroon, Chad, Niger and Nigeria). Seasonal factors, such as the rainy season with flooding, as well as poor hygiene conditions and population movements in the area contribute to this unusually high incidence of cholera. Nevertheless this area known to be endemic for cholera is regularly affected by small outbreaks.   WHO, with international and national health partners, is providing technical support to the ministries of health at the country and sub-regional levels. WHO is working to strengthen surveillance activities. Supplies for case management and chlorination of water have also been dispatched to some of the affected areas. The Ministries of Health of the four affected countries are planning to organize a cross border meeting in Abuja in order to reinforce the surveillance and revise the preparedness and response plans to cholera epidemics in the localities around Lake Chad.  Breakdown by country:  Cameroon:   7 869 cases including 515 deaths (case fatality rate -CFR 6.5%) have been reported in 6 regions (Centre, Extreme Nord, Littoral, Nord, Ouest, Sud Ouest) between 6 May and 3 October. The majority of cases (97%) are reported from the Extreme Nord region. Preventive and control measures are ongoing. A Cholera Command and Control Centre has been set up in Maroua in the Extreme Nord region by the Ministry of Health with the support from WHO as health cluster lead and in close collaboration with other health and water and sanitation partners. The role of the Centre is to provide technical coordination for partners in the areas of epidemiological and laboratory surveillance, case management, social mobilization, logistics and infection control/water and sanitation in treatment centres. The system should also provide immediate alerts of new outbreaks.  Chad:   2 508 cases including 111 deaths (CFR 4.4%) are reported in 12 health districts in 6 regions between 13 July and 3 October. Prevention and control measures are being implemented by national authorities with support from several partners (Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF), National Red Cross, Oxfam,  The International Rescue Committee (IRC), International Medical Corps (IMC), UNICEF, WHO).  Niger:   976 cases including 62 deaths (CFR 6.4%) have been reported in Diffa, Maradi, Tahoua and Zinder regions between 3 July and 1 October. Preventive and control measures are ongoing.  Nigeria:   29 115 cases including 1 191 deaths (CFR 4.1%) have been reported between 4 January and 3 October, in 144 LGAs in 15 States including the Federal Capital Territory (FCT).

The case was identified as a 27 year-old fisherman working in the Gambia (Tandji locality) who presented with clinical symptoms of fever and jaundice.  Blood specimens from the patient were laboratory tested at the Institut Pasteur de Dakar and found to be IgM positive by ELISA and confirmed with PRNT, a more specific test. The patient had no history of yellow fever vaccination.   A second suspected case reported in Thies region, Senegal was also a fisherman from Tanji locality in the Gambia, showing  neurologic symptoms including an altered mental state. This particular case was found not to be confirmed by the Institut Pasteur de Dakar.   Through WHO, the Gambia has been informed of the situation in order to assess the epidemiological situation in Tandji locality.   Senegal conducted a yellow fever preventive mass vaccination campaign in 2007, targeting more than 3.1 million people in all 18 districts not previously protected through outbreak response. In the health district of Thies, 314 713 people were targeted and vaccination coverage of 91.8% (88.3 - 95.3%) was achieved. This preventive campaign was part of the global Yellow Fever Initiative which aims to prevent yellow fever epidemics and secure adequate yellow fever vaccine supply for Africa. Routine infant immunization coverage against yellow fever in Senegal was 79% in 2009.   After the Gambia yellow fever outbreak in 1978-1979, a village-based serological retrospective study estimated some 8000 cases and 1700 deaths had occurred.  According to some reports, the national vaccination coverage was estimated to be 95% in January 1979. The national routine infant immunization coverage reported for 2009 was 99%.   In the face of high routine and recent preventive vaccination coverage in both Senegal and the Gambia, an epidemic is not anticipated and emergency vaccination is not required at this time. Investigation around sporadic cases may identify pockets of unimmunized individuals and guide immunization and vector control strategies at the local level for those at risk.  "

"2010","http://www.who.int/csr/don/2010_09_08/en/index.html"," Polio in Angola  and the Democratic Republic of the Congo   8 September 2010 -  Angola and the Democratic Republic of Congo (DR Congo) are experiencing outbreaks of wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1).   In Angola, the outbreak which began in April 2007, has this year spread to re-infect previously polio-free areas in Angola (the provinces of Bie, Bengo, Huambo, Lunda Norte, Lunda Sul and Uige), as well as to neighbouring DR Congo, re-infecting Kasai Occidental province which borders Angola.  This outbreak is classified as 're-established' transmission, as it has persisted for a period greater than 12 months.   In DR Congo, in addition to newly-imported virus from Angola this year, a case detected in Katanga province with onset of paralysis on 20 June 2010, in the east of the country, has been genetically-linked to virus previously imported from Angola, last detected in eastern DR Congo in 2008.  In 2009, a case was detected in Burundi, which was linked to the same transmission chain.  DR Congo was previously regarded by the Advisory Committee on Poliomyelitis Eradication (ACPE) has having 'suspected' re-established transmission, and this suspicion is now confirmed.   Given the recent progress achieved in Nigeria (99% reduction in cases this year compared to the same period in 2009), west Africa (no cases since 1 May 2010) and the Horn of Africa (no cases in more than 12 months), central Africa is now considered to be the greatest risk to Africa's polio eradication efforts.  Angola's outbreak is currently the only geographically expanding outbreak in Africa.  This situation increases the risk to achieving the next global milestone of the new Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI) Strategic Plan 2010-2012, the cessation of all re-established WPV transmission by end-2010.   There is currently a high risk of international spread of WPV from Angola and DR Congo, given the limited impact to date of control measures and the historical cross-border spread from both countries.  In 2010, outbreak response in both countries has been inadequate to stop transmission of the imported viruses.  Independent monitoring of supplementary immunization activities (SIAs) indicate as many as 25% of children are regularly missed during SIAs in key areas of Angola (including Luanda, Lunda Norte and Lunda Sul).  In DR Congo, no response activities have been conducted in the east of the country since November 2009.  The outbreaks require urgent action to reach a higher proportion of children with oral polio vaccine (OPV) across Angola and DR Congo and improve surveillance across Angola and DR Congo.  Due to sub-national surveillance gaps, further undetected circulation of WPV1 cannot be ruled out.  Given the increasingly widespread transmission of WPV1 in Angola and documented spread to DR Congo, the World Health Organization (WHO) considers the risk of further international spread as high.  Given persistent undetected transmission of WPV1 in eastern DR Congo, and historical evidence of international spread, WHO considers the risk of further international spread as high.   Urgent improvements are needed during SIAs and to fill sub-national surveillance gaps for acute flaccid paralysis (AFP), through strengthened engagement and ownership by provincial- and district-level political and administrative leadership.  In Angola, National Immunization Days (NIDs) are planned for September, and additional responses are being discussed.  In DR Congo, SIAs are being carried out in response to the new importations, and an urgent SIA and surveillance strengthening plan is being developed in response to the detection of the new case in the east of the country which confirmed persistent undetected transmission in that area.   It is important that countries across central Africa and the Horn of Africa strengthen AFP surveillance, in order to rapidly detect any poliovirus importations and facilitate a rapid response.  Countries should also strengthen population immunity levels to minimise the consequences of any virus introduction.  As per recommendations outlined in WHO's International Travel and Health , guidance travelers to and from Angola and DR Congo should be fully protected by vaccination.

"2010","http://www.who.int/csr/don/2010_08_27/en/index.html"," Influenza - update 115  Situation update:   27 August 2010 -  Worldwide, H1N1 2009 virus transmission remains most intense in parts of India and in parts of the temperate southern hemisphere, particularly New Zealand and more recently in Australia.   In India, the current national influenza H1N1 2009 epidemic, which first began during late May and June 2010 in the southern state of Kerala (co-incident with start of the monsoon rains), continues to remain regionally intense in several western and southern states as well as the in the capital. The western state of Maharashtra, which to date, has detected the highest numbers of cases (including fatal cases), continues to record the most intense influenza H1N1 2009 activity, however, the rate of increase in the numbers of new cases reported per week appears to have slowed during mid-August 2010, suggesting that current epidemic activity may be peaking. Increasing H1N1 2009 activity has also been reported in Delhi since early August 2010, and in the southern states of Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh since late July 2010. A number of other states, primarily in western and northern India, reported small numbers of new cases during the third week of August 2010, suggesting that low level circulation of H1N1 2009 may be more geographically extensive. Since late July 2010, the vast majority of influenza virus detections have been H1N1 2009.   In New Zealand, H1N1 2009 virus transmission remains active and locally intense, particularly in areas that were less affected during last winter's first pandemic wave. As of the third week of August 2010, the overall national weekly rate of consultations for ILI continued to increase above the seasonal baseline for the fourth consecutive week, however, the rate of increase in ILI consultations appears have slowed during the most recent reporting week, suggesting that peak epidemic activity may occur in the weeks ahead. Although the overall national rates of ILI consultations has not exceeded levels seen during the 2009 winter pandemic wave, several areas of New Zealand, most notably Hawke's Bay, Hutt Valley and Lakes, are all reporting local rates of ILI consultations that match or surpass rates seen at the national level at the peak of last winter's pandemic wave. The vast majority of influenza virus detections during the current epidemic period have been H1N1 2009.   In Australia, during the first two weeks of August 2010, data from several surveillance systems indicate that influenza activity is increasing, including a one week increase in the national rate of ILI consultations, regional spread of ILI activity in three southern and eastern states, and a sharp two week rise in the proportion of sentinel respiratory samples testing positive for influenza virus (an increase from 5 to 15%). However, overall national rates of ILI consultations remain well below levels observed during the 2009 winter pandemic wave. The majority of recent influenza virus isolations have been characterized as H1N1 2009, however, seasonal H3N2 viruses have also been detected at low levels. Of note, an online influenza surveillance system that tracks the rate of ILI in the community found that recent increases in the rate of ILI have been among persons who were unvaccinated against H1N1 2009 virus. Although significantly fewer severe and total cases of H1N1 2009 virus infection have been detected this year compared to last winter, the median age of H1N1 2009 virus infected cases appears to similar although slightly older (21 vs. 26 years old).

The current epidemic of influenza H1N1 (2009) does not appear to have peaked yet in these states. Overall, 79 new laboratory confirmed H1N1 (2009) associated deaths were officially reported across India during the week of August 2-8. During last two weeks of July 2010, more than 1/3 of respiratory specimens tested positive for influenza virus in the state of Maharashtra, all of which were H1N1 (2009). In the southern Indian state of Kerala, where recent influenza activity in India was first detected, transmission of H1N1 (2009) virus appears to have peaked during late June and early July 2010 and has declined substantially since.  Seasonal influenza B viruses are also known to be currently circulating in India, although at lower levels than H1N1 (2009) viruses.   In New Zealand, the national consultation rate for ILI continued to increase, particularly in recent weeks, passing the seasonal baseline during the last week of July 2010. The majority of influenza viruses detected during the current winter epidemic have been H1N1 (2009). Influenza activity (as indicated by rates of ILI, hospitalizations, and absenteeism) has been geographically uneven but focally intense in some areas, particularly those areas that experienced milder epidemics during the previous winter 2009 pandemic wave. Nationally, overall rates of ILI and numbers of severe and fatal cases remain well below levels seen during the winter 2009 pandemic wave, however, the situation continues to evolve and the current epidemic has yet to peak.   Except in South Africa and New Zealand, overall influenza activity and rates of respiratory diseases remained low in other countries of the temperate southern hemisphere (Australia, Chile, and Argentina). In South Africa, active circulation of seasonal influenza H3N2 and type B viruses was observed during June and July 2010.   Influenza H1N1 (2009) continued to circulate at low to moderate levels over the past month in the tropics of the Americas (Costa Rica, Colombia, Peru, Bolivia, Brazil), West Africa (Ghana), and South and Southeast Asia (India, Bangladesh, Thailand, Cambodia, Singapore, Malaysia).   Variable circulation of seasonal influenza viruses continues to be detected in all regions of the world.

"2010","http://www.who.int/csr/don/2010_08_06/en/index.html"," Pandemic (H1N1) 2009 - update 112  Weekly update   6 August 2010 -  As of 1 August 2010, worldwide more than 214 countries and overseas territories or communities have reported laboratory confirmed cases of pandemic influenza H1N1 2009, including over 18449 deaths.   WHO is actively monitoring the progress of the pandemic through frequent consultations with the WHO Regional Offices and member states and through monitoring of multiple sources of information.  Situation update:   The overall situation remains largely unchanged since the last update. Globally, pandemic influenza transmission remains most active in parts of South Asia and in limited areas of tropical South and Central America. In the temperate zone of the southern hemisphere, overall seasonal and pandemic influenza activity remains low, except in South Africa, where peak wintertime influenza transmission due to circulating seasonal influenza viruses (H3N2 and type B) might have recently occurred. Seasonal influenza viruses, particularly H3N2 viruses, continue to circulate in parts of Central America, East Africa, and Southeast Asia.   During the 2010 winter of the temperate southern hemisphere, the most active areas of influenza virus transmission have been in South Africa, where the majority of influenza virus detections have been seasonal influenza H3N2 and type B viruses; pandemic influenza virus has been detected there only sporadically. Elsewhere in Argentina, Chile, New Zealand, and Australia, overall influenza activity remains low and below levels observed during recent, mild, pre-pandemic influenza seasons; among the latter three countries, pandemic influenza viruses have been detected most frequently, however, low level co-circulation of seasonal influenza H3N2 and type B has also been observed. In South Africa, the current wintertime epidemic of seasonal influenza appears to have peaked during early July 2010 and stabilized since then; to date, influenza type B viruses have accounted for a greater proportion of influenza viruses detected among severe (SARI) cases than have influenza H3N2 viruses. Chile and Argentina continue to observe low levels of respiratory diseases in the population, and much of what has been observed in recent months has been due to circulation of respiratory viruses other than influenza, particularly RSV. In Australia and New Zealand there has been a sustained upward trend in the rates of ILI over the past 6-8 weeks, particularly in recent weeks, however, overall rates remain well below those observed during the same period in 2009 during the first pandemic wave in the southern hemisphere. Data on the clinical and epidemiological pattern of pandemic influenza virus infection during the current winter season have been limited due to the fact that there has been limited virus transmission to date; however, preliminary data suggests that the pattern has not changed compared to what was seen last winter during the first pandemic wave in the southern hemisphere.   In Asia, the most active areas of pandemic influenza virus transmission currently are in parts of India, and to a much lesser extent, in parts of Nepal and Bhutan. Transmission appears to have peaked in the southern state of Kerala, while transmission remains moderately intense in the western state of Maharashtra, and may be increasing in several eastern states, including Orissa and West Bengal. Limited, preliminary data suggests that the overall intensity and severity of the current regional epidemics in India do not yet appear to exceed what was observed during the first wave in 2009, however, it is too early make a complete assessment of the situation as the regional epidemics are still evolving. Similarly, there has been no evidence to date to suggest that clinical and epidemiological pattern of pandemic influenza virus infection has changed during the current period of active transmission. Overall, across India, approximately ¼ of respiratory samples tested positive for influenza as of third week of July 2010; however, in at least one region of India, up to 1/3 of respiratory samples tested positive for influenza.  In addition to the recent increases in circulation of pandemic influenza viruses in India, there has been, in recent months, active circulation of seasonal influenza type B viruses, and to a lesser extent, seasonal influenza H3N2 viruses. In neighboring Bangladesh, Bhutan, and Nepal, but not Sri Lanka, there is limited evidence of low levels of pandemic influenza virus transmission, including reports of localized outbreaks in Nepal and Bhutan. In Southeast Asia, low to sporadic levels of co-circulating pandemic and seasonal influenza viruses have been detected across the region over the past month.   In the tropical regions of the Americas, active subregional co-circulation of seasonal and pandemic influenza viruses continued to be detected during July 2010. Since early June 2010, predominantly seasonal influenza H3N2 viruses have circulated in Panama, Nicaragua, and Honduras; seasonal influenza B and more recently H3N2 viruses in El Salvador; and, predominantly pandemic influenza and H3N2 viruses in Costa Rica and Columbia.   In sub-Saharan Africa (excluding South Africa), Ghana continued to report sustained transmission of pandemic influenza virus during June and July 2010; during the most recent reporting week, 27% of respiratory samples tested positive for pandemic influenza virus. Limited data indicate that seasonal influenza H3N2 and B viruses continued to circulate at variable levels in parts of eastern Africa and central Africa, respectively. In Cameroon, a sustained period of active transmission of seasonal influenza B viruses, which began during early June 2010, now appears to be subsiding. In Kenya, there has been persistent low level circulation of seasonal H3N2 viruses since late April 2010.   In the temperate regions of the Northern hemisphere, pandemic and seasonal influenza viruses have been detected only sporadically or at very low levels during the past month.

WHO is actively monitoring the progress of the pandemic through frequent consultations with the WHO Regional Offices and member states and through monitoring of multiple sources of information.  Situation update:   Summary: Worldwide, overall pandemic and seasonal influenza activity remains low. In the southern hemisphere (where the winter season is in progress), current influenza activity remains variable: ranging from low and stable activity in Chile and Argentina, to low but increasing activity in Australia and New Zealand, to elevated and recently peaked activity in South Africa. Significant seasonal and pandemic influenza virus transmission continues to be detected at variable levels across parts of the tropics, particularly in several countries of the Americas and South and Southeast Asia.   In the southern hemisphere, overall influenza virus transmission remains low to sporadic, except in South Africa, where recent wintertime influenza activity appears to have peaked, and in Australia and New Zealand, where influenza activity remains low but continues to increase steadily, particularly in recent weeks. In South Africa, virologic data from outpatient sentinel surveillance suggest that the current period of influenza activity (primarily attributable to circulating seasonal influenza H3N2 and B viruses) began and rose sharply during early June 2010, with a likely peak and decline in activity occurring since the first week of July 2010. Data on the full extent of severe illness associated with recent influenza activity are not yet available, however, early reports suggest the current influenza season has been generally mild in terms of levels of clinical disease in the population. In Australia, overall rates of ILI remain low and have increased only slightly over the past four weeks (through the second week of July 2010); however, of note, the number of viral respiratory disease presentations to the emergency departments in Western Australia increased more dramatically during the same period. Overall, the proportion of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza virus was 5% at sentinel laboratories across Australia, of which approximately two-thirds were pandemic influenza viruses and one-third were seasonal influenza H3N2 viruses; respiratory viruses other than influenza continue to predominant in several regions of Australia. In New Zealand, rates of ILI are below the seasonal baseline but have increased steadily over the past month; recent reports suggest that more significant, but geographically uneven increases may have occurred during the third week of July 2010. Although the number of influenza virus detections remains low, the majority of virus isolates in New Zealand have been pandemic influenza virus. The most recent available virologic surveillance data (mid-July 2010) from Chile and Argentina indicate that very low levels of influenza viruses are currently circulating in the southern temperate regions of the Americas; the predominant circulating influenza viruses in Chile and Argentina are pandemic and seasonal influenza type B viruses, respectively. Recently data from Chile also indicate that overall levels of ILI in the population remain very low, except in the Los Lagos region, which has seen recent late season increases in levels of ILI slightly above the epidemic threshold.   In Asia, the most active areas of pandemic influenza virus transmission currently are in parts of India, particularly in several western and southern states. The majority of new cases continue to be reported in the southern state of Kerala and in the western state of Maharashtra, the later of which reported a sharp increase in the number of cases, including small numbers of fatal cases, between the second and third week of July 2010. Smaller numbers of new cases have also been recently reported in other southern states and in the eastern state of West Bengal. In neighboring Bangladesh, low level co-circulation of pandemic and seasonal influenza type B viruses continued to be detected over the month of July 2010. In Southeast Asia, low levels of pandemic influenza virus circulation were detected in several countries during July 2010, including Cambodia, Singapore and Malaysia. Significant levels of seasonal influenza H3N2 viruses continued to circulate in Singapore.   In sub-Saharan Africa (excluding South Africa), limited data indicate that seasonal influenza H3N2 and B viruses continued to circulate in parts of eastern Africa (Kenya) and central Africa (Cameroon), respectively. Ghana, in West Africa, reported sustained transmission of pandemic influenza virus during June and early July 2010.   In the tropical regions of the Americas, active subregional co-circulation of seasonal and pandemic influenza viruses was detected during July 2010. Since early June 2010, predominantly seasonal influenza H3N2 viruses have circulated in Panama and Nicaragua; predominantly seasonal influenza B viruses in El Salvador and Bolivia; and predominantly pandemic influenza viruses in Costa Rica and Columbia.   In the temperate regions of the Northern hemisphere, pandemic and seasonal influenza viruses have been detected only sporadically or at very low levels during the past month.

Nineteen of the cases were fatal.  Seven virologically related cases have been detected in the Russian Federation, the only other country in the WHO European Region to confirm cases. The poliovirus causing the outbreak originated in northern India. This is the first outbreak of polio since the Region was certified polio-free in 2002.   In response to the outbreak, four rounds of national immunization days (NIDs) with oral polio vaccine have been held in Tajikistan. Coverage was reported to be high and confirmed by independent monitors.  The most recent round was conducted on 15–19 June (except in Dushanbe and six surrounding regions, where it started on 13 June). Preliminary data report nationwide coverage of 99.3%. Coverage higher than 97% is reported from all regions and in the groups aged 0–6 and 7–15 years.   The most recent polio case had onset on 12 June, and the number of new cases of acute flaccid paralysis (AFP)  – of which polio can be one of the causes – being detected and reported to WHO has dropped sharply.  However, there is not sufficient virological testing data from the recent AFP cases to revise WHO's assessment of the risk for further international spread, which remains 'high'.   A joint national/international surveillance review is under way, under the auspices of the Ministry of Health, to further inform the current risk assessment and guide additional surveillance and immunization activities.  The need for additional rounds of mass oral polio vaccine (OPV) immunization will be based on an ongoing evaluation of epidemiological and laboratory data.  International travellers to and from polio affected areas should continue to be adequately immunized against polio as recommended in Chapter 6 of International Travel and Health guidance.   The European Regional Commission for the Certification of Poliomyelitis Eradication met in Copenhagen, Denmark, on 28–29 June 2010. Addressing the meeting, Ms Zsuzsanna Jakab, WHO Regional Director for Europe, noted that the outbreak in Tajikistan threatens both the polio-free status of the Region and the eradication of polio globally.   The Commission recognized that the European Region has reached a critical juncture and its polio-free status is in jeopardy. The gravity of the situation requires that all Member States reinforce their polio surveillance so that any spread will be detected rapidly and effective control measures instituted at the earliest possible moment.   Neighbouring countries are responding to the outbreak by heightening surveillance while reviewing immunization status of children and conducting necessary supplementary immunization activities. Uzbekistan has held three national rounds of supplementary immunization with efforts to synchronize these rounds with Tajikistan in May and June. The first round of nationwide NIDs started in Turkmenistan on 12 July 2010, and Kyrgyzstan started its first round on 19 July.

WHO is actively monitoring the progress of the pandemic through frequent consultations with the WHO Regional Offices and member states and through monitoring of multiple sources of information.  Situation update:   Globally pandemic influenza activity remains low. The most active areas of influenza transmission remained in the tropical zones; primarily in West Africa, Central America, the Caribbean, and South and Southeast Asia, although activity is localized to relatively small areas in each region. In the temperate zone of the southern hemisphere, Australia and New Zealand have showed signs of increased respiratory disease in recent weeks. Both countries have continued to detect low levels of predominantly pandemic H1N1 influenza virus. In South Africa, the influenza season is well under way and is predominantly associated with seasonal influenza B and H3N2 viruses and small numbers of pandemic H1N1 influenza viruses.   In the temperate zone of the southern hemisphere, overall influenza activity remained low but with notable increases in recent weeks in some areas.  South Africa had been experiencing a sharp increase in the proportion of respiratory samples testing positive for influenza viruses since late June 2010. For the current reporting week, 30-40% of sentinel respiratory samples from patients with severe acute respiratory infections (SARI)/influenza-like-illness (ILI) tested positive for influenza. Respiratory disease activity was associated primarily with seasonal influenza B and H3N2 viruses, with a much smaller number of pandemic H1N1 influenza viruses. Australia has reported a gradual increase in the number of respiratory disease consultations due to ILI since end of June to early July 2010 although this is of similar to the levels experienced in 2008. This increase of respiratory disease activity may be accounted for in part by circulation of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV).  Influenza viruses in Australia have been about 2/3 pandemic H1N1 influenza and 1/3 seasonal influenza H3N2.  In New Zealand, rates of ILI have markedly increased compared to the previous reporting week but still remained below the seasonal baseline, primarily associated with pandemic H1N1 influenza  virus. In Chile and Argentina, national rates of ILI remained low relative to last year at the same period of time.   In Asia, overall pandemic influenza activity remained low. The most active areas of pandemic H1N1 influenza virus transmission are in India, Cambodia and Singapore. Significant transmission of pandemic H1N1 influenza is occurring in the Southern states of Kerala and the Western state of Maharashtra, India. Cambodia has recently observed an increase in the proportion of respiratory samples testing positive for influenza virus (primarily pandemic H1N1 influenza and seasonal influenza H3N2) since early June 2010. In Singapore, levels of acute respiratory infections (ARI) have increased the past four weeks (through the week ending July 17). The proportion of patients with ILI testing positive for pandemic H1N1 influenza continues to be stable (15%); however, seasonal H3N2 viruses are currently the predominant circulating type/subtype of influenza viruses in Singapore.   In sub-Saharan Africa, the current situation was largely unchanged since the last update. Pandemic H1N1 and seasonal influenza activity continued to be observed in several countries. Ghana has had a sustained circulation of pandemic H1N1 influenza virus since June 2010. Small numbers of seasonal influenza H3N2 viruses continued to be detected in eastern Africa.   In the tropical regions of the Americas, the situation has remained similar to the previous week. Overall pandemic and seasonal influenza activity were low, except in pockets of Central and South America with co-circulation of pandemic and seasonal influenza H3N2 viruses (Costa Rica had predominantly pandemic H1N1 influenza virus, while Nicaragua and Panama had predominantly influenza H3N2 virus).   In the temperate regions of the Northern hemisphere, pandemic and seasonal influenza viruses have been detected only sporadically or at very low levels during the past month.

Given the persistent and widespread transmission of wild poliovirus, ongoing sub-national surveillance gaps and recent further spread of WPV1 internationally, WHO considers as high the risk of further international spread into neighbouring countries.  As per  recommendations outlined in WHO's International Travel and Health recommendations, travellers to and from Angola should be fully protected by vaccination.  Actions   Angolan Minister of Health Dr José Vieira Dias Van-Dúnem re-affirmed Angola's strong commitment to stop polio transmission by end-2010.   In 2010, Angola has conducted a sub-national supplementary immunization round using monovalent OPV type 1 (mOPV1) targeting high risk provinces from 7-9 May, a national immunization round from 11-13 June using a combination of trivalent OPV (tOPV) and mOPV1,  and mop-up immunization campaigns with mOPV1 in response to WPV1 cases (on 23-25 April in Bie, and on 4-6 June and 18-20 June in Lunda Norte and Lunda Sul).  Further national immunization rounds are planned for early August and September.  The Democratic Republic of the Congo conducted mop-ups on 4 June and 18 June with mOPV1, and further outbreak response is currently being planned.  Recommendations   In 2009 and 2010, immunization coverage has been sub-optimal, with as much as 25% of children regularly missed during supplementary immunization activities (SIAs) Urgent action is needed to ensure that all children in Angola are reached with oral poliovirus vaccine during the SIAs taking place in August and September, through strengthened engagement and ownership of SIA operations by provincial- and district-level political and administrative leadership.   It is important that countries across central Africa, in particular those bordering Angola, strengthen disease surveillance for AFP, in order to rapidly detect any poliovirus importations and facilitate a rapid response.  Countries should also continue to boost routine immunization coverage against polio to minimize the consequences of any introduction.  For more information   Global Polio Eradication Initiative   "
"2010","http://www.who.int/csr/don/2010_07_16/en/index.html"," Pandemic (H1N1) 2009 - update 109  Weekly update   16 July 2010 -  As of 12 July, worldwide more than 214 countries and overseas territories or communities have reported laboratory confirmed cases of pandemic influenza H1N1 2009, including over 18337deaths.   WHO is actively monitoring the progress of the pandemic through frequent consultations with the WHO Regional Offices and Member States and through monitoring of multiple sources of information.  Situation update:   Worldwide, overall pandemic influenza activity remains low. The most active areas of pandemic influenza virus transmission currently are in parts of South Asia, West Africa, and Central America. In the temperate zone of the southern hemisphere, pandemic and seasonal influenza activity has remained low during the first half of the southern hemisphere winter, except in South Africa, where increased detections of primarily seasonal influenza viruses (type B and H3N2) were reported during late June and early July 2010. Seasonal influenza H3N2 viruses continue to circulate at varying levels across parts of the Americas, Africa, and Southeast Asia. Increased seasonal influenza activity continues to be observed in several countries of Central America.   To date, most countries of the temperate zone of the southern hemisphere, with the exception of South Africa, have reported low overall levels of respiratory disease activity and low to sporadic levels of pandemic and seasonal influenza virus circulation during the first half of the southern hemisphere winter season. Pandemic influenza viruses have been detected only sporadically or at low levels in most of these countries. As reported last week, South Africa began observing a sharp increase in the proportion of sentinel respiratory samples testing positive for influenza virus (primarily seasonal influenza B and H3N2) during late June 2010, reaching a peak of ~50% detection rate during the first week of July 2010, and falling to ~40% during the second week of July 2010. In Chile (as of late June 2010) and Argentina (as of early July 2010), the most recent available data show that influenza activity remains sporadic in Argentina and low in Chile (~5% respiratory samples tested positive for influenza, 84% of which were pandemic virus with small numbers of seasonal influenza H3N2 and type B detected as well). In both Chile and Argentina, RSV has been the predominant circulating respiratory virus since mid-April 2010. In Australia, as of the last week of June 2010, overall rates of ILI remained low and below levels observed during the same period in past three winter seasons. Although a small cluster of pandemic influenza cases, including a few hospitalized cases, were recently detected in the Northern Territory of Australia, pandemic and seasonal influenza virus detections remain otherwise sporadic, albeit slightly increased during late June and early July 2010. Similarly, in New Zealand, rates of ILI have remained low and below the seasonal baseline, with only sporadic detections of pandemic and seasonal H3N2 viruses through the first week of July 2010. In both Australia and New Zealand, current levels of ILI are similar to those observed during the same period in 2008, when the influenza season was noted to have arrived and peaked late in winter.   In Asia, overall pandemic influenza activity remains low to sporadic, except in parts of southern and western India, Malaysia, and Singapore. As reported last week, in India, transmission of pandemic influenza virus remains active but stable in the southern state of Kerala. The extent of illness in the community is currently being assessed and monitored by the Government of India. Similar numbers of new cases, including small numbers of fatal cases, have been reported on a weekly basis since transmission first increased during mid-June 2010. Recent, small increases in pandemic influenza virus circulation have also been observed since mid-June 2010 in other southern and western states of India, particularly in the western state of Maharashtra. In Singapore, levels of ARI increased during the first two weeks of July 2010; however, the intensity of pandemic influenza virus transmission has declined during June and July 2010 after peaking in May 2010. The proportion of patients with ILI testing positive for pandemic influenza virus in Singapore remained stable (14-16%) during first two weeks of July 2010. In addition, substantial co-circulation of seasonal influenza H3N2 viruses (with pandemic H1N1 virus) was detected in Singapore throughout May and June 2010. In Malaysia, numbers of new cases of pandemic influenza continued to decline; overall pandemic influenza activity fell substantially in June and early July 2010 after peaking during mid-April to mid-May 2010. Low levels of seasonal influenza type B viruses (and to much lesser extent pandemic influenza virus) continue to circulate across northern and southern China as levels of ILI remain stable and near seasonal levels seen in the same period in recent years. Low levels of pandemic and seasonal influenza (H3N2 and type B) viruses also continued to circulate in Hong Kong SAR (China), Chinese Taipei, and parts of Thailand.   In the tropical regions of the Americas, overall pandemic and seasonal influenza activity remained low, except in parts of Central and South America, where there has been recent active co-circulation of pandemic and seasonal influenza H3N2 viruses. The majority of recent active transmission of pandemic influenza virus has been reported in Colombia, Costa Rica, and to a lesser extent in Cuba. In Colombia, although low level circulation of pandemic influenza viruses has persisted throughout the first half 2010, a second period of active transmission began in mid-May 2010, peaked in June 2010, has now largely subsided during the second of week of July 2010. Similarly, in Costa Rica, low level circulation of pandemic virus has persisted throughout 2010, however, there has been a recent resurgence in active transmission (though less intense than the initial 2009 wave) of pandemic influenza virus during June 2010. As reported previously, in Panama, a sharp increase in the circulation influenza A viruses (particularly H3N2, but also small numbers of pandemic H1N1) was reported over the month of June 2010; a high intensity of respiratory diseases and a moderate impact on healthcare services continued to be reported during the second week of July 2010. In Nicaragua, recent active transmission of seasonal influenza H3N2 viruses, which began during late May 2010 and peaked during mid June 2010, appears to have largely subsided during recent weeks. Many countries in the region continue to report ongoing co-circulation of other respiratory viruses, most notably RSV.   In sub-Saharan Africa, the current situation is largely unchanged since the last update. Pandemic and seasonal influenza activity continues to be observed in several countries. Ghana, in West Africa, continued to have a sustained resurgence in circulation of pandemic influenza virus during June 2010, more than several months after the first period of pandemic activity peaked (early April 2010). Seasonal influenza type B viruses continue to circulate in parts of central and southern Africa, particularly in Cameroon, where an increase in influenza type B virus circulation was observed during June 2010. Small numbers of seasonal H3N2 viruses continue to be detected across Africa, particularly in eastern and southern Africa; the most recent detections have been reported in Kenya and South Africa.   Overall, in the temperate regions of the northern hemisphere (North America and Europe), pandemic and seasonal influenza viruses have been detected only sporadically or at very low levels during the past month.

WHO is actively monitoring the progress of the pandemic through frequent consultations with the WHO Regional Offices and Member States and through monitoring of multiple sources of information.  Situation update:   Worldwide, overall pandemic influenza activity remains low. Active circulation of pandemic influenza virus persists in areas of the tropics, particularly in South and Southeast Asia, the Caribbean and West Africa. Overall pandemic and seasonal influenza activity has remained low during the early part of the current winter season in the temperate zone of the southern hemisphere. Low levels of seasonal influenza (H3N2 and type B) viruses were detected during June 2010 in South Africa, while Chile, Australia, and New Zealand, have all recently detected low levels of predominantly pandemic influenza virus. Increasing seasonal influenza activity has also recently been observed in several countries of Central America.   Although rates of respiratory disease have begun to increase in several countries of the temperate zone of the southern hemisphere, little pandemic or seasonal influenza activity has been seen so far during early part of the winter season. In South Africa, a sharp increase in the detection rate of influenza virus, primarily seasonal influenza H3N2 and type B, was observed during the later part of June and early July (> 40% of sentinel respiratory samples from patients with ILI tested positive for influenza during the first week of July); however, levels of respiratory illness-related outpatient consultations and hospitalizations do not appear to be significantly elevated. In Australia, slight increases in the rates of ILI have been reported in recent weeks, however, the overall number of influenza virus detections (primarily pandemic H1N1 and seasonal H3N2) remain low. In New Zealand, rates of ILI have steadily increased over the month of June; however, only small numbers of predominantly pandemic influenza virus have been detected so far. In both Australia and New Zealand, current levels of ILI are similar to those observed during the same period in 2008, when the influenza season was noted to have arrived and peaked late in winter. In Chile, overall levels of ILI remain very low; less than 5% of respiratory samples tested positive for influenza in late June 2010 (the majority were pandemic H1N1 virus with small numbers of seasonal influenza H3N2 and type B detected as well). In Argentina, overall levels of ILI remained low and below levels observed during the past three winter influenza seasons; only small numbers of seasonal influenza type B viruses have been detected during recent weeks.

Smaller increases in pandemic influenza virus circulation have also been observed since mid-June 2010 in other southern and western states of India. In Singapore, levels of ARI and pandemic influenza virus transmission declined during June 2010 after peaking in May 2010; the proportion of patients with ILI testing positive for pandemic influenza virus remained stable at 16% during the first week of July 2010. Of note, substantial co-circulation of pandemic and seasonal influenza H3N2 viruses was detected in Singapore throughout May and June 2010. In Malaysia, declining numbers of new cases of pandemic influenza continued to be reported suggesting that overall pandemic influenza activity continued to decline substantially in June 2010 after peaking during mid-April to mid-May 2010. Very low level of seasonal influenza type B viruses continue to circulate across China, Hong Kong SAR (China), Chinese Taipei and the Republic of Korea.   In the tropical regions of the Americas, overall pandemic and seasonal influenza activity remained low, except in parts of Central America, where there has been recent active co-circulation of pandemic and seasonal H3N2 viruses.

"2010","http://www.who.int/csr/don/2010_07_07/en/index.html"," Nigeria: mass lead poisoning from mining activities, Zamfara State   7 July 2010 -  A major outbreak of lead poisoning in children has been occurring in Zamfara State, Nigeria since at least March 2010, related to the processing of lead-rich ore for the extraction of gold.   During March-April the Zamfara State Ministry of Health was informed by Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) of an increasing number of childhood deaths and illness in villages in the two Local Government Areas (LGAs) of Bukkuyum and Anka. At the request of the Nigerian Federal Ministry of Health, the United States Centers for Disease Control (US CDC) deployed a response team to assist in investigating this outbreak. At the same time, the Blacksmith Institute sent a team from TerraGraphics Environmental Engineering Inc to conduct an environmental assessment. These teams worked with the national and state authorities, MSF, and the country office of the World Health Organization (WHO). The investigations confirmed severe lead poisoning in more than 100 children in the villages of Dareta and Yargalma, with a mean blood lead concentration of 119 μg/dL (levels as low as 10 μg/dL are associated with impaired neurological development in young children).  Moreover, lead concentrations in soil of >100,000 ppm were found in and around habitations in the villages (the limit for residential areas applied in the USA and France is 400 ppm).  WHO response   The Nigerian authorities requested WHO to provide further technical and financial assistance to contain the current outbreak and prevent similar outbreaks in the future.  WHO deployed a team comprising three epidemiologists, a clinical toxicologist, a paediatrician, an environmental health expert and a laboratory specialist. This team, working with staff from the State Ministry of Health, confirmed a high degree of environmental lead contamination from the same cause in 5 additional villages (Tungar-dadj, Abare, Duza and Sunke (Anka LGA), and Tungar-guru (Bukuyum LGA)). A random sample of 56 children under 5 years from the villages of Abare and Tungar-guru revealed that >90% had blood lead concentrations above 45 μg/dL (for which chelation therapy is recommended) and >70% had concentrations above 70 μg/dL (for which urgent treatment is needed). A high incidence of convulsions and death in young children has been noted in these villages, and there is a strong likelihood that this is due to lead poisoning. An extrapolation from the above figures suggests that >2000 individuals are in need of chelation therapy in the 5 villages. Data from the State Ministry of Health hospital registry suggest there are still more villages where lead poisoning may be a problem.  Situation update   MSF is currently providing chelation therapy for around 100 children in two specially established units within the general hospitals of Bukkuyum and Anka. WHO has been collaborating with MSF and a number of international clinical toxicologists on the development of treatment protocols.  The WHO team has also helped to set up a laboratory service for measuring blood lead concentrations in Gusau, and has provided training in surveillance and the management of lead poisoning.   In order to prevent further deaths and long-term neurological impairment in affected children it is essential that the lead contamination is removed from villages and particularly the domestic compounds. In addition, it is essential that poisoned children are identified and given appropriate chelation therapy. For chelation therapy to be effective, however, children must be removed from exposure to lead, which means that they cannot return to their homes after treatment until their environment has been cleaned. The Blacksmith Institute and TerraGraphics are working with the Zamfara State authorities to decontaminate the villages of Dareta and Yargalma. Considerably more resources are needed to decontaminate the other 5 villages and to identify and treat all of the children, as well as affected adults (in particular pregnant women) in these villages.   WHO is working with its UN partners to mobilize funds to deal with this unprecedented environmental emergency.

"2010","http://www.who.int/csr/don/2010_07_02/en/index.html"," Pandemic (H1N1) 2009 - update 107  Weekly update   2 July 2010 -  As of 27 June, worldwide more than 214 countries and overseas territories or communities have reported laboratory confirmed cases of pandemic influenza H1N1 2009, including over 18239 deaths.   WHO is actively monitoring the progress of the pandemic through frequent consultations with the WHO Regional Offices and Member States and through monitoring of multiple sources of information.  Situation update:   Summary: Worldwide, overall pandemic and seasonal influenza activity remains low.  In the temperate regions of the Southern Hemisphere, Chile, and Argentina report low activity and only sporadic detections of both pandemic and seasonal influenza viruses during the early part of winter. South Africa, New Zealand, and Australia have all recently noted slight increases in the rate of respiratory disease. South Africa recently reported their first case of confirmed H1N1; however, the predominant influenza virus there currently is seasonal influenza A(H3N2).  The H3N2 virus detected in South Africa is similar to the Perth-like strain, which is currently a component of the trivalent seasonal influenza vaccine. Active transmission of pandemic influenza virus still persists in localized areas of the tropics, particularly in South and Southeast Asia, the Caribbean and West Africa. During the last 2 to 3 weeks, seasonal influenza H3N2 viruses have also been detected at increasing levels in Nicaragua, and low levels or sporadically in Australia, Central America, South Africa and East Africa. Global circulation of seasonal influenza virus type B viruses persists at low levels in parts of East Asia, Central Africa, and Central America.   Regional Details: In most countries of the temperate zone of the southern hemisphere (Chile, Argentina, South Africa, Australia, and New Zealand) pandemic and seasonal influenza viruses have been detected only sporadically in June 2010 and activity is low, indicating a late start of the influenza season compared to 2008. Overall levels of respiratory disease in the population remain low. In Argentina, small numbers of influenza type B viruses were detected during mid June 2010. In both Chile and Argentina, respiratory syncitial virus (RSV) continued to be the predominant circulating respiratory virus resulting in high rates of respiratory illness in children. In South Africa, small and slightly increasing numbers of seasonal H3N2 and type B viruses were detected during mid June 2010. In both Australia and New Zealand, levels of ILI are increasing, but still below recent historical seasonal levels.   In Asia, the most active areas of pandemic influenza virus transmission currently are in parts of southern India, Bangladesh, Singapore, and Malaysia. Rates are decreasing in the latter three countries but in India, the number of laboratory confirmed cases of pandemic influenza has increased since mid June.  This activity has been primarily observed in Southern state of Kerala, and includes reports of a number of severe and fatal cases, particularly among pregnant women. In Bangladesh, pandemic and seasonal influenza type B viruses co-circulated at low levels during early June 2010. In Singapore, during the third week of June 2010, the levels of ARI remained below warning levels and the proportion of patients with ILI testing positive for pandemic influenza virus fell from 19% to 15%. In Malaysia, data suggests that overall pandemic influenza activity has declined throughout June 2010 though pandemic virus continues to circulate at low levels. Throughout East Asia, influenza activity remained very low. In China and Japan, levels of ILI remained at or below baseline levels for the summer months. Low and declining levels of influenza type B viruses continued to circulate across China, Hong Kong SAR (China), Chinese Taipei and Republic of Korea.   In the tropical regions of the Americas, overall pandemic and seasonal influenza activity remained very low. In Cuba, pandemic influenza virus transmission remains active but has declined substantially since peaking during mid-April to mid-May 2010; no new fatal cases have been reported over the past five reporting weeks. In several countries of the region, there has been recent circulation of seasonal influenza A (H3N2) viruses (Venezuela during May 2010) and B viruses (Bolivia during March and May 2010; El Salvador during late May and early June 2010).  Nicaragua notably has seen a sharp increase in the detection of seasonal influenza A (H3N2) and Panama has detected low numbers of the same. In addition, after 20 weeks with no circulating pandemic virus, Panama reported the detection of pandemic influenza (H1N1) 2009 in early June. Many countries in the area also report ongoing co-circulation of other respiratory viruses, most notably RSV.   In sub-Saharan Africa, pandemic and seasonal influenza activity has been observed in several countries. Ghana, in West Africa, continues to have active circulation of pandemic influenza virus several weeks after activity peaked during early April 2010.  Seasonal influenza type B viruses continue to circulate in parts of central and southern Africa, most notably in Cameroon. As reported in previous updates, small numbers of seasonal H3N2 viruses continue to be detected across Africa, particularly in eastern Africa; the most recent detections have been reported in Ghana, Kenya, and South Africa during mid June 2010.

WHO is actively monitoring the progress of the pandemic through frequent consultations with the WHO Regional Offices and Member States and through monitoring of multiple sources of information.  Situation update:   Worldwide, overall pandemic and seasonal influenza activity remains low. Active transmission of pandemic influenza virus persists in parts of the tropics, particularly in the Caribbean, West Africa, and South and Southeast Asia. Pandemic and seasonal influenza viruses have been detected only sporadically during the early part of winter in the temperate regions of the southern hemisphere. Global circulation of seasonal influenza virus type B viruses has declined substantially and persists at low levels in parts of East Asia, Central Africa, and Central America. During the past month, seasonal influenza H3N2 viruses have been detected at low levels across parts of East Africa and South America.   In most countries of the temperate zone of the southern hemisphere (Chile, Argentina, South Africa, Australia, and New Zealand) pandemic and seasonal influenza viruses have been detected only sporadically during the first two weeks of June 2010 and overall levels of respiratory disease in the population remain low. In Chile, during the second week of June, approximately 1% samples tested positive for influenza (the majority were pandemic influenza virus). In Argentina, small numbers of influenza type B viruses were detected during early June 2010. In both Chile and Argentina, respiratory syncitial virus (RSV) continued to be the predominant circulating respiratory virus. In South Africa, very small numbers of seasonal H3N2 and type B viruses were detected since the beginning of June 2010. In both Australia and New Zealand, levels of ILI are below recent historical seasonal levels and there have been only sporadic detections of seasonal or pandemic influenza virus during the first half of June 2010.   In Asia, the most active areas pandemic influenza virus transmission currently are in parts of southern India, Bangladesh, Singapore, and Malaysia. In India, there have been recent reports of increasing pandemic influenza activity in the southern state of Kerala, including reports of small numbers of severe and fatal cases, particularly among pregnant women; the extent of illness in the community is currently being assessed. In Bangladesh, pandemic and seasonal influenza type B viruses continued to co-circulate at low levels during early June 2010. In Thailand, limited data suggests that there continues to be low levels of pandemic and seasonal influenza virus co-circulating in parts of the country. In Singapore, during the third week of June 2010, levels of ARI declined below warning levels and the proportion of patients with ILI testing positive for pandemic influenza virus fell from 28% to 19%. In Malaysia, limited data suggests that overall pandemic influenza activity declined throughout June 2010 as pandemic virus continued to circulate at low levels. Throughout East Asia, overall pandemic and seasonal activity remained very low to sporadic. In China and Japan, levels of ILI remained at or below baseline levels for the summer months. Low and declining levels of seasonal influenza type B viruses continued to circulate across China, Hong Kong SAR (China), and Chinese Taipei.   In the tropical regions of the Americas, overall pandemic and seasonal influenza activity remained very low, except in Cuba and Colombia, where low levels of pandemic influenza virus continue to circulate (approximately 8% of respiratory samples tested positive for pandemic influenza in both countries during the early part of June 2010). In Cuba, pandemic influenza virus transmission remains active but has declined substantially since peaking during mid-April to mid-May 2010; no new fatal cases have been reported over the past four reporting weeks. In Colombia, persistent but low level circulation of pandemic influenza virus has increased slightly since late May 2010; however, the overall level of respiratory diseases in the population was reported to be low to moderate during mid June 2010. In several countries of the region, there has been recent circulation of seasonal influenza viruses including type A (Venezuela during May 2010) and B (Bolivia during March and May 2010; El Salvador during late May and early June 2010). Variable ongoing co-circulation of other respiratory viruses, including RSV, continues to be reported across the region.   In sub-Saharan Africa, pandemic and seasonal influenza activity has been limited to several countries. Ghana, in West Africa, continued to have active circulation of pandemic influenza virus long after overall activity peaked during early April 2010; the proportion of respiratory samples testing positive for pandemic influenza virus increased from 16% to 23% during the first two weeks of June 2010. Seasonal influenza type B viruses continue to circulate in parts of central and southern Africa, most notably in Cameroon. As reported in previous updates, small numbers of seasonal H3N2 viruses continue to be detected across Africa, particularly in eastern Africa; the most recent detections have been reported in Ghana, Kenya, and South Africa during the second week of June 2010. The persistence of H3N2 in this area over time very likely represents sustained community transmission of the virus.   Overall, in the temperate regions of the northern hemisphere (North America and Europe), pandemic and seasonal influenza viruses have been detected sporadically or at very low levels during the past month.   The Global Influenza Surveillance Network (GISN) continues monitoring the global circulation of influenza viruses, including pandemic, seasonal and other influenza viruses infecting, or with the potential to infect, humans including seasonal influenza.

WHO is actively monitoring the progress of the pandemic through frequent consultations with the WHO Regional Offices and Member States and through monitoring of multiple sources of information.  Situation update:   The situation remains largely unchanged since the last update. Overall pandemic influenza activity remains low worldwide with geographically limited circulation of pandemic influenza virus in parts of the tropics, particularly in parts of Central America and the Caribbean and in parts of South and Southeast Asia. Seasonal influenza type B viruses continue to circulate at low levels across Asia and to a lesser extent across parts of Africa and South America. Recently re-emerged seasonal influenza H3N2 viruses continue to circulate in East Africa. As countries of the temperate southern hemisphere enter winter, overall only sporadic influenza activity has been detected so far.   In tropical region of the Americas, low or waning circulation of pandemic virus has been primarily reported in Costa Rica (since early 2010) and in Cuba (last reported at the end of May 2010), respectively. In Cuba and to a lesser extent in Costa Rica, recent pandemic influenza activity has been associated with small numbers of fatal cases. In Colombia, during the first week of June 2010, an increasing trend of respiratory diseases was associated with regional spread of pandemic influenza activity and a small number of new fatal cases, likely reflecting increasing but low level circulation of pandemic influenza virus. Throughout the rest of the region, there have been only sporadic detections of pandemic influenza virus during the past month. In several countries of the region, there has been recent circulation of seasonal influenza viruses including type A (Venezuela since May 2010) and B (Bolivia since March 2010). Throughout the region there has been variable ongoing co-circulation of other respiratory viruses, particularly RSV.   In Asia, pandemic influenza virus continues to actively circulate in Malaysia, Singapore, and to a much lesser extent in parts of India, Bangladesh, and Bhutan. In Malaysia, limited data suggest that virus transmission persists but continues to decline; the number of new cases reported per week plateaued during mid-April 2010 and began to decline at the end of May 2010. In Singapore, during the second week of June 2010, the levels of ARI remained near the warning level but below the epidemic threshold; approximately 28% of respiratory samples from patients with ILI tested positive for pandemic influenza virus. In South Asia, low level circulation of pandemic influenza virus has persisted in western India (since early 2010) and Bangladesh (since late February 2010); in India but not Bangladesh, regional, low intensity transmission during 2010 has been associated with small numbers of fatal cases over time. Seasonal influenza type B viruses continue to co-circulate with pandemic influenza virus in Bangladesh and have only recently emerged and become predominant in India, although at low levels. Of note, there have been recent media reports of increasing pandemic influenza activity in the southern Indian state of Kerala and more information is expected to become available soon. In Bhutan, there have recent reports of school outbreaks of pandemic influenza virus infection in three separate areas of the country, however, the overall intensity of respiratory diseases in the population was reported to be low.   In Sub-Saharan Africa, pandemic influenza virus continued to circulate at low levels in limited areas of East and West Africa. During the first week of June 2010, 10% and 16% of all respiratory samples tested positive for pandemic influenza virus in Tanzania and Ghana, respectively. Small but significant numbers of seasonal H3N2 viruses continue to be been detected in Kenya and Tanzania since late May 2010.   Overall, in the temperate regions of the northern hemisphere, pandemic influenza viruses have been detected only sporadically during the past month. In the temperate southern hemisphere, only two countries, Chile and Uruguay, have recently reported small numbers of pandemic influenza virus detections. Other respiratory viruses, most notably RSV, are known to be circulating in Chile and Argentina. During first two weeks of June 2010, small numbers of seasonal influenza H3N2 and type B viruses have been detected in South Africa. In New Zealand and Australia, overall levels of ILI remain low; only sporadic detections of seasonal and pandemic influenza viruses have been recently reported in Australia.

As countries of the temperate southern hemisphere enter winter, only sporadic influenza activity has been detected so far, except in Chile and Uruguay, both of which have recently reported small numbers of pandemic influenza virus detections. Although seasonal influenza B viruses have been the predominant type of influenza virus circulating worldwide since the end of February 2010, there have been increasing but low level detections of seasonal influenza H3N2 viruses, particularly in South America and in East Africa.   In the tropics of the Americas, overall pandemic influenza activity is low, however, both seasonal influenza H3N2 and type B viruses are actively circulating in parts of tropical South America. Active but declining transmission of pandemic influenza virus continues to be detected primarily in Cuba. Since early 2010, pandemic influenza virus has circulated at low levels in Costa Rica. Sporadic detections of pandemic influenza virus continue to be reported in Brazil. During the most recent reporting week (last week of May 2010), both Brazil and Venezuela reported regional spread of influenza activity associated with an increasing trend of respiratory diseases. In Venezuela, recent influenza activity (which began during early May 2010) has been predominantly due to circulating seasonal influenza A viruses. In Bolivia, circulation of seasonal influenza viruses, predominantly type B, was observed between March and May 2010 and now appears to be subsiding.   In Asia overall pandemic influenza virus transmission remains low, except in parts of tropical South and Southeast Asia, particularly Singapore, Malaysia, and Bangladesh. In Singapore, overall levels of ARI remained slightly below the epidemic threshold and the proportion of respiratory samples testing positive for pandemic influenza virus increased slightly to 34% (during the last week of May 2010). In Malaysia, limited data suggests that pandemic influenza virus transmission has begun to decline since plateauing during May 2010. In Bangladesh, there has been stable persistent low level co-circulation of pandemic and seasonal influenza B viruses since March 2010. Sporadic detections of pandemic influenza virus continued to be reported across other parts of Asia. In East Asia, overall influenza activity remains low, however, seasonal influenza B viruses continue to circulate at low and declining levels.   In Sub-Saharan Africa, pandemic influenza virus continued to circulate at low levels in parts of West Africa, most notably in Ghana. During the most recent reporting week, 13% of all respiratory samples tested positive for pandemic influenza virus in Ghana.

WHO is actively monitoring the progress of the pandemic through frequent consultations with the WHO Regional Offices and Member States and through monitoring of multiple sources of information.  Situation update:   Active but declining transmission of pandemic influenza virus continued to be detected in parts of the Caribbean and Southeast Asia. In the countries of temperate southern hemisphere there is no evidence yet to suggest that the winter influenza season has begun, however there has been limited localized pandemic influenza virus transmission in Chile. In the rest of the world, overall pandemic influenza virus transmission remains low. Seasonal influenza B viruses are currently the predominant type of influenza virus circulating globally, although at low levels. Of note, during the later part of May 2010, low but significant levels of predominantly seasonal influenza H3N2 viruses have been detected in several countries of East Africa.   In the tropical zone of the Americas, the most active areas of pandemic influenza virus transmission continue to be in parts of the Caribbean. In Cuba, pandemic influenza virus transmission has begun to decline after plateauing since mid-April 2010. In both Costa Rica and Columbia, there has been persistence of low level circulation of pandemic influenza virus since the beginning of 2010. Sporadic detections of pandemic and other seasonal influenza viruses, particularly type B, have been reported from several countries in the region during May 2010. Other respiratory viruses, for example RSV, are known to be circulating to varying extents in different countries across the region.   In Asia, the most active areas of pandemic influenza virus transmission currently are in parts of South and Southeast Asia, particularly in Singapore and Malaysia, and to a lesser extent in Bangladesh. In Singapore, during the last week of May 2010, levels of ARI fell below the epidemic threshold and the proportion of respiratory samples testing positive for pandemic influenza fell from 39% to 29%. In Malaysia and Bangladesh, the numbers of new cases reported per week have been relative stable for the past 6 and 3 weeks, respectively, suggesting stable persistence of low level pandemic virus circulation during the past month in these areas. Very low levels of pandemic influenza virus also continue to circulate in parts of western and southern India, and in parts of Thailand. Sporadic detections of pandemic influenza virus have been reported in many countries across the region during the past month. In East Asia, overall influenza activity remains low, however, seasonal influenza B viruses continue to circulate at low and declining levels across the region.   In Sub-Saharan Africa, active but declining levels of pandemic influenza virus transmission continue to be detected in parts of West Africa, most notably in Ghana. During the most recent reporting week, 15% of all respiratory samples tested positive for pandemic influenza virus in Ghana. Sporadic detections of seasonal influenza B continue to be reported in central Africa. Of note, low but significant numbers of seasonal H3N2 viruses were recently detected in Kenya (6 of 57 respiratory samples tested) and Tanzania (13 of 25 respiratory samples tested) during the most recent reporting week.   Overall, in the temperate regions of the northern and southern hemisphere, pandemic influenza viruses have been detected only sporadically during the past month. In the temperate southern hemisphere, Chile is the only country to recently report small number of pandemic influenza cases in a few areas of the country suggesting that overall transmission is currently limited. Other respiratory viruses, most notably RSV, are known to be circulating in Chile, Paraguay, and Argentina.  There have been no recent detections of pandemic influenza virus in South Africa. In New Zealand and Australia, overall levels of ILI remain low; only sporadic detections of seasonal and pandemic influenza viruses have been recently reported in Australia.

"2010","http://www.who.int/csr/don/2010_05_28/en/index.html"," Pandemic (H1N1) 2009 - update 102  Weekly update   28 May 2010 -  As of 23 May, worldwide more than 214 countries and overseas territories or communities have reported laboratory confirmed cases of pandemic influenza H1N1 2009, including over 18114 deaths.   WHO is actively monitoring the progress of the pandemic through frequent consultations with the WHO Regional Offices and Member States and through monitoring of multiple sources of information.  Situation update:   The most active areas of pandemic influenza virus transmission currently are in parts of the Caribbean and Southeast Asia, where low level circulation is occurring. Except for localized areas of pandemic influenza activity in parts of Chile, there is little evidence of pandemic influenza activity in the temperate zone of the southern hemisphere. Of note, Respiratory Syncitial Virus (RSV) is widely circulating in South America resulting in an increase in respiratory disease activity, complicating somewhat the interpretation of syndromic surveillance data from the area.  RSV primarily affects children under the age of 5 years. Seasonal influenza A viruses continue to be detected at low to sporadic levels in all regions.  Influenza B has been reported in increasing but low numbers in South America, where it only recently appeared, while it is decreasing in Asia.   In the Caribbean and Central America, Cuba and to a much lesser extent Costa Rica, continue to experience active circulation of pandemic influenza virus. In Cuba, current pandemic influenza activity, which began during late February 2010, remains unchanged since reaching a plateau during mid-April 2010; in addition, over the past month, there have been sporadic detections of seasonal influenza B viruses and also evidence of co-circulation of other respiratory viruses. In Costa Rica, sustained low levels of pandemic influenza virus have been co-circulating with other respiratory viruses since the beginning of 2010. Several other countries in the region continue to report sporadic detections of seasonal influenza B viruses and low level co-circulation of other respiratory viruses.   In the tropical zone of South America, pandemic and seasonal influenza viruses continued to circulate at low to sporadic levels. In Peru, recent regional increases in respiratory diseases activity (in children under age 5) has been largely associated with circulating respiratory syncitial virus (RSV). In Colombia and Brazil, low levels of pandemic and seasonal influenza H3N2 viruses have been detected over the past month. In Bolivia, a recent period of circulation of predominantly seasonal influenza type B viruses appears to have concluded.   In Asia, overall pandemic influenza activity remains low to sporadic, except in limited areas of south and southeast Asia, particularly Singapore, Malaysia, and Bangladesh. In Singapore, levels of ARI have been elevated since April 2010 and in recent weeks have remained near epidemic threshold; approximately 39% of respiratory specimens from ILI patients tested positive for pandemic influenza virus during mid May 2010. In neighboring Malaysia, limited data suggest that active pandemic influenza virus circulation persist after recent activity peaked during mid April 2010; small numbers of fatal cases have been reported since that time. In Bangladesh, co-dominant circulation of pandemic and seasonal influenza B viruses has been observed since mid April 2010, however, the overall intensity of respiratory diseases was reported to low during this period. Low levels of pandemic influenza virus continued to circulate in western India, while low and declining levels of seasonal influenza B viruses continued to be reported across East Asia.   In Sub-Saharan Africa, limited data from several countries continues to suggest that active transmission of pandemic influenza virus in West Africa has now largely subsided. In addition to the persistence of low level circulation of pandemic influenza virus in Ghana, sporadic detections of pandemic influenza virus have been reported during the past month in Cameroon, Angola, and Rwanda. In Cameroon, there has been persistent active circulation of seasonal influenza B viruses since mid-March 2010.   In the temperate regions of the northern and southern hemisphere, overall pandemic influenza activity remains low to sporadic. In southern hemisphere, Chile continues to report increased ILI in several regions of the country (notably Los Lagos), however, the increase in respiratory disease activity has been predominantly associated with circulating RSV and only to a much lesser extent pandemic influenza virus. In neighboring Argentina, Paraguay, and Uruguay, all recent respiratory diseases activity during the past month has been associated with viruses other than influenza. Similarly, there have been no recent detections of influenza virus in South Africa. In New Zealand and Australia, overall levels of ILI remain low; only sporadic detections of seasonal influenza H3N2 and pandemic influenza viruses have been recently reported in Australia.   The Global Influenza Surveillance Network (GISN) continues monitoring the global circulation of influenza viruses, including pandemic, seasonal and other influenza viruses infecting, or with the potential to infect, humans including seasonal influenza.

"2010","http://www.who.int/csr/don/2010_05_27/en/index.html"," Yellow fever in Cameroon   27 May 2010 -  On 25 January  2010, the Ministry of Health (MoH), Cameroon reported one case of yellow fever in Kumba district in the country's south-western region, close to the border with Nigeria's Cross River State.   The index case was identified as a 16 year-old female student in Kake high school. She presented with a clinical picture of fever and jaundice. Onset of symptoms started on 11 January with fever. She had  no history of yellow fever vaccination and survived. The index case was identified through routine yellow fever surveillance system.   Laboratory specimens from this case were found to be IgM positive by ELISA method at the National Laboratory in the Institut Pasteur, Yaoundé, Cameroon and confirmed positive  by plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT)- a more specific test for yellow fever- at the regional  reference laboratory for yellow fever at the Institut Pasteur in Dakar, Senegal.   Following identification of the index case, an outbreak investigation was conducted in the area.  The investigation  identified one person as symptomatic (fever). Laboratory tests by ELISA method of serum samples for this and 50 other contact were found to be negative.   Cameroon conducted a yellow fever mass vaccination campaign in 62 at-risk-districts covering a population of 7.4 million in May 2009. The two districts of Kumba and Muyuka were however, not part of the campaign as they had no history of yellow fever cases in the past 50 years.   The Ministry of Health plans to vaccinate 345,592 people in Kumba and Muyuka districts. The country has requested support from the International Coordinating Group on Yellow Fever Vaccine Provision (YF-ICG), which manages the global emergency stockpile of yellow fever vaccine. The ICG has approved support for the vaccination campaign, which will be funded by the GAVI Alliance through the World Health Organization. This support is part of the global Yellow Fever Initiative which aims to prevent devastating yellow fever epidemics and secure adequate yellow fever vaccine supply for Africa.

WHO is actively monitoring the progress of the pandemic through frequent consultations with the WHO Regional Offices and Member States and through monitoring of multiple sources of information.  Situation update:   The current situation is largely unchanged since the last update. The most active areas of pandemic influenza virus transmission currently are in parts of the Caribbean and Southeast Asia. In the temperate zone of the northern and southern hemisphere, overall pandemic influenza activity remains low to sporadic. In central Africa, there has been increased transmission of seasonal influenza type B viruses, accounting for 85% of all influenza isolates in the region.  Influenza B also continues to be detected at low levels across parts of Asia and Europe, and has now been reported in Central America.   In the tropical region of the Americas, the most active areas of pandemic influenza virus transmission continue to be in parts of the Caribbean. In Cuba, a second period of active community transmission of pandemic influenza virus began during late February 2010, peaked during late April 2010, and has been declining since; this second period of transmission, although associated with severe and fatal cases, appears to be less intense overall than the first period of transmission which occurred during late September to late November 2009. In contrast, in the Dominican Republic, low to moderate intensity of respiratory diseases activity has been primarily associated with co-circulation of respiratory viruses other than influenza; only sporadic detections of seasonal influenza viruses have been reported. Low levels of pandemic influenza viruses have been circulating across parts of Central America and tropical areas of South America, for example, in Mexico since December 2009, in Colombia and Brazil since early 2010, and in Guatemala since early April 2010. Nicaragua and Honduras have also been recently reporting geographically regional spread of influenza viruses, however, the relative proportions of seasonal influenza, pandemic influenza, and other respiratory virus detections are not known. In contrast, in Panama, low levels of respiratory disease over the past three months have been primarily associated with circulating respiratory viruses other than influenza. Of note, Bolivia experienced a recent period of low but sustained transmission of seasonal influenza type B viruses between late February and early May 2010. There continues to be evidence from several countries in this region that there is ongoing co-circulation of influenza with other respiratory viruses (including respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), and adenovirus).   In Asia, the most active areas of pandemic influenza virus transmission are in parts of South and Southeast Asia, particularly in Bangladesh, Malaysia, and Singapore. In Malaysia, limited data suggests that a second period of active pandemic influenza virus transmission has been occurring since early April 2010, but overall activity may have recently stabilized and does not appear to exceed pandemic influenza activity seen during an earlier period of transmission lasting from July until early September 2009. In Singapore, levels of ARI have remained elevated since mid April 2010; during the most recent reporting week, levels of ARI exceeded the epidemic threshold and the proportion of patients with ILI testing positive for pandemic influenza virus infection was 39%. In Bangladesh increased co-circulation of pandemic influenza and seasonal influenza type B viruses has been detected since mid April 2010 but now appears to have stabilized. Low level circulation of pandemic influenza continues to persist in Thailand and in the western and southern parts of India; sporadic detection of pandemic influenza continue to be reported in Cambodia and in the Philippines. In East Asia, only sporadic detections of pandemic influenza virus are being reported; seasonal influenza type B viruses have been predominant in this region, however circulation appears to be declining in China and the Republic of Korea.   In the temperate regions of the northern and southern hemisphere, overall pandemic influenza activity remains low to sporadic. In Australia and New Zealand, slight increases in ILI activity were reported; however, in Australia, these increases have been attributed primarily to circulating respiratory viruses other than influenza. In the southern temperate regions of the Americas, only sporadic detections of influenza viruses have been reported, except in Chile, which continues to report localized areas of increased ILI activity (in the Los Lagos area) associated with co-circulation of pandemic influenza and other respiratory viruses. In Europe, very low to sporadic levels of pandemic and seasonal influenza type B viruses continue to be detected. Seasonal influenza type B virus persists mainly in parts of eastern and northern Europe. Georgia reported an increase in the number of respiratory disease consultations due to influenza-like-illness (ILI), mainly in children (under age 5) and school-age children (5-14 years old age group); whether this increase is associated with pandemic influenza A (H1N1) virus is not yet known.   In Sub-Saharan Africa, limited data from several countries suggest that active transmission of pandemic influenza virus in West Africa has now largely subsided. In Ghana, 6% of respiratory samples tested positive for pandemic influenza virus during the most recent reporting week. Across the rest of region, the pandemic influenza virus continues to be detected sporadically or at low levels, most recently in Angola and Rwanda. Sporadic detections of seasonal influenza H3N2 and influenza B viruses have been reported in western, central Africa and to a lesser extent southern Africa.   The Global Influenza Surveillance Network (GISN) continues monitoring the global circulation of influenza viruses, including pandemic, seasonal and other influenza viruses infecting, or with the potential to infect, humans including seasonal influenza.

WHO is actively monitoring the progress of the pandemic through frequent consultations with the WHO Regional Offices and Member States and through monitoring of multiple sources of information.  Situation update:   The most active areas of pandemic influenza virus transmission currently are in parts of the Caribbean and Central America, and to a lesser extent in West Africa and South and Southeast Asia. In the temperate zone* of the northern and southern hemisphere, overall pandemic influenza activity remains sporadic. Seasonal influenza virus type B continues to be detected at low levels across parts of Asia, Africa, and Europe.   In the tropical region of the Americas, pandemic influenza virus transmission remains most active in parts of the Caribbean, and to a lesser extent in Central America. In Cuba, pandemic influenza activity continued to decline after a recent period of intense transmission which began during late February 2010 and may have peaked during late April 2010. Geographically widespread pandemic influenza activity was reported in Jamaica (during much of February through May 2010) and in the Dominican Republic (since late April); however, other respiratory viruses are known to be co-circulating in the region and overall respiratory disease activity during this period was reported to remain low to moderate. The overall SARI** rate from sentinel sites in selected Caribbean countries (Dominica and Jamaica) increased since mid April 2010, however, the extent to which this was due circulating pandemic influenza virus versus other respiratory viruses is not known. In Central America and the tropical regions of South America: Nicaragua, Honduras, Guatemala, Columbia, Bolivia, and Peru all reported regional spread of influenza during one or more weeks since late April 2010 suggesting that low levels of circulating pandemic influenza virus persist in the region. In addition, there is evidence from several countries in this region that there is ongoing co-circulation of influenza with other respiratory viruses (including respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), and adenovirus).   In Asia, the most active areas of pandemic influenza virus transmission currently are in parts of South and Southeast Asia, particularly in Bangladesh, Malaysia, and Singapore. In Bangladesh, a consistently increasing trend of respiratory disease associated with co-circulation of pandemic influenza and seasonal influenza type B viruses have been reported since mid April 2010; however, the overall intensity of respiratory diseases activity remains low to moderate. In Malaysia, limited data suggest that recent pandemic influenza activity began during early April 2010 and has been stably elevated since mid April 2010. In Singapore, the overall level of ARI remained stably elevated above baseline since early April 2010; 38% of respiratory specimens tested positive for pandemic influenza virus infection during the most recent reporting week. In Thailand, a recent period of sustained transmission of pandemic virus, extending from January until early April 2010, appears to have largely subsided. In India, low levels of pandemic influenza virus continued to be detected in several western and southern states, however, the overall level of respiratory diseases in the population remains low. In Indonesia, a period of low level circulation of seasonal H3N2 viruses which began during early February 2010 now appears to be subsiding. In East Asia, pandemic influenza virus is being detected only sporadically, however, persistent but declining levels of circulating seasonal influenza type B viruses continued to be reported, particularly in China, Hong Kong SAR (China), and in Chinese Taipei.   In Sub-Saharan Africa, limited data from several countries suggest that active transmission of pandemic influenza virus continues to decline in parts of West Africa, while low levels of seasonal influenza type B viruses continue to circulate in parts of Central Africa and to a lesser extent in East Africa. In Ghana, pandemic influenza virus detections continued decline after peaking during early April 2010; during the most recent reporting week, 10%of respiratory specimens tested positive for pandemic influenza virus. There was no report of influenza activity in Senegal where a peak of pandemic influenza activity was observed in late February 2010. In central Africa, Cameroon continued to report co-circulation of pandemic and seasonal influenza type B viruses; the latter continued to be predominant during the most recent reporting week with approximately 31% of all respiratory samples testing positive for seasonal influenza type B and 4% testing positive for pandemic influenza virus. Sporadic detections of seasonal influenza H3N2 and influenza B viruses have been reported across eastern and western Africa over the past month.   In the northern and southern temperate regions of the Americas, only sporadic detections of influenza viruses have been reported, except in Chile, which continued to report localized areas of increased ILI activity associated with co-circulation of pandemic influenza and other respiratory viruses.   In Europe, pandemic influenza virus continues to be detected sporadically as the overall intensity of respiratory diseases remained low across the continent. Low level circulation of seasonal influenza type B virus persists in parts of southern and eastern Europe, notable in the Russian Federation and in Italy. The Global Influenza Surveillance Network (GISN) continues monitoring the global circulation of influenza viruses, including pandemic, seasonal and other influenza viruses infecting, or with the potential to infect, humans including seasonal influenza.

"2010","http://www.who.int/csr/don/2010_05_12/en/index.html"," Rift Valley fever in South Africa- update 2   12 May 2010 -  On 11 May 2010 Bernhard-Nocht-Institute for Tropical Medicine in Germany reported that additional laboratory analyses conducted both in Germany and South Africa on the German tourist who was preliminarily diagnosed with Rift Valley Fever (RVF) following her return from South Africa, was in-fact infected with Rickettsia and not with RVF virus.   Rickettsia, commonly known as tick fever is a bacterium which can cause many diseases that are transmitted by blood-sucking parasitic arthropods such as fleas, lice and ticks. Symptoms of rickettsial infections include rash, fever, and flulike symptoms.  African tick bite fever is caused by rickettsia africae and tends to be a milder illness, with less prominent rash and little tendency to progress to complicated disease. All rickettsial diseases respond to treatment with antibiotics such as doxycycline and tetracycline   As of 10 May, the Government of South Africa has reported 186 confirmed cases of RVF in humans, including 18 deaths, in Free State Province, Eastern Cape Province, Northern Cape Province, Western Cape, and North West Province.  RVF is a viral disease that primarily affects animals (such as cattle, buffalo, sheep, goats and camels).  The disease can also affect humans.  The main mode of transmission of RVF is via direct or indirect contact with the blood or organs of infected animals. Human infections have also resulted from the bites of infected mosquitoes. There is evidence that humans may become infected by ingesting the unpasteurized or uncooked milk of infected animals.   WHO advises no international travel restriction to or from South Africa. However, WHO recommends that visitors to South Africa, especially those intending to visit farms and/or game reserves, avoid coming into contact with animal tissues or blood, avoid drinking unpasteurized or uncooked milk or eating raw meat.   All travelers should take appropriate precautions against bites from mosquitoes and other blood-sucking insects (including the use of insect repellents, wearing long-sleeved shirts and trousers, and sleeping under mosquito nets).

"2010","http://www.who.int/csr/don/2010_05_07/en/index.html"," Pandemic (H1N1) 2009 - update 99  Weekly update   7 May 2010 -  As of 2nd May, worldwide more than 214 countries and overseas territories or communities have reported laboratory confirmed cases of pandemic influenza H1N1 2009, including over 18001 deaths.   WHO is actively monitoring the progress of the pandemic through frequent consultations with the WHO Regional Offices and Member States and through monitoring of multiple sources of information.  Situation update:   The most active areas of pandemic influenza virus transmission currently are in parts of West Africa, the Caribbean, and Southeast Asia. In the temperate zone of the northern and southern hemisphere, overall pandemic influenza activity remains sporadic. Seasonal influenza virus type B continues to be detected sporadically across Asia, Africa, Europe, and the Americas, however, low levels of late season virus circulation have primarily detected in East and Central Asia, southern Europe, and central Africa.   In Sub-Saharan Africa, limited data from several countries suggest that active transmission of pandemic influenza virus persists in parts of West Africa while low levels of seasonal influenza type B viruses continue to circulate in parts of central Africa. In Ghana, pandemic influenza virus detections may be declining after peaking during early April 2010; during the most recent reporting week, 14% of respiratory specimens tested positive for pandemic influenza virus. In Cameroon, low levels of pandemic and seasonal influenza type B virus continue to co-circulate, though the latter have been predominant during April 2010. In the Democratic Republic of Congo, circulation of seasonal influenza H3N2 viruses during February and mid-March 2010 has been largely replaced by circulation of seasonal influenza type B viruses during April 2010. Localized, low level pandemic influenza virus circulation continues to be observed in parts of East Africa, particularly in Rwanda and Tanzania. Sporadic detections of seasonal influenza H3N2 viruses continue to be reported across eastern, central, and western Africa.   In tropical zone of the Americas, limited data suggest that pandemic influenza virus transmission remains active in several countries. In Central America, Guatemala reported three consecutive weeks of an increasing trend of respiratory diseases activity associated with regional spread of pandemic influenza virus and detection of severe cases. In Cuba, detections of pandemic virus and numbers of severe cases have increased since late March, however overall pandemic influenza activity may have recently peaked during the most recent reporting week. In Peru, the number of pneumonia cases in children under 5 years of age in the capital area has been increasing for the past seven weeks and remains above the epidemic threshold; however, the extent to which these pneumonia cases have been due to pandemic influenza H1N1 virus versus other respiratory viruses circulating in the region, is not known. Although the overall intensity of respiratory diseases across the region remained low to moderate during April 2010, for short periods of time, circulation of pandemic influenza virus was reported to widespread (in Cuba and Barbados) or regional (in Mexico, Honduras, Nicaragua, Columbia, Venezuela, Brazil, Ecuador and Bolivia).   In Southeast Asia, pandemic influenza virus continues to actively circulate in several countries of the region, however, respiratory disease trends in the region are variable. In Malaysia, limited data suggest that pandemic influenza virus transmission persists with ongoing reports of new cases (including severe cases) and media reports of several school outbreaks, particularly during late April and early May 2010. In Singapore, the national level of ARI has been steadily increasing since early April 2010 and now exceeds the epidemic threshold; 37% of sentinel respiratory specimens tested positive for influenza during the most recent reporting week. In Thailand, the proportion of sentinel outpatients with ILI and sentinel inpatients with pneumonia testing positive for pandemic influenza virus infection has declined significantly since peaking during late March 2010.   In South Asia, the most active area of pandemic influenza virus transmission continues to be in Bangladesh, which continues to report increasing respiratory diseases activity associated with co-circulation of pandemic and seasonal influenza type B viruses since mid April 2010. However, persistent low level co-circulation of both viruses has been detected since late February 2010. In India, localized low level circulation of pandemic influenza virus continues to be detected in parts of western and southern India.   In East Asia, very low levels of pandemic influenza virus continue to be detected. Although overall rates of respiratory illness remain low across the region, recent low levels of influenza activity in a number of countries in the region have been largely due to circulating seasonal influenza type B viruses. Three countries in region, Mongolia, China, and South Korea, each experienced a period of sustained seasonal influenza type B virus circulation following an earlier, generally more intense, wintertime period of pandemic influenza virus transmission. China and South Korea continue observe active but declining levels of seasonal influenza type B virus circulation.   In the temperate zone of the southern hemisphere, overall pandemic and seasonal influenza activity remains sporadic, except in Chile, where there is evidence of low level community circulation of pandemic influenza virus, including detection of small numbers of severe cases; however it too early to know if this signals an early start to wintertime influenza season. The national level of ILI in Chile remained near baseline; however, in at least two southern regions the region specific level of ILI was elevated above baseline, and in one region, Los Lagos, the region specific baseline has been elevated slightly above the epidemic threshold for the past four weeks. Of note, 6% of sentinel respiratory samples in Chile tested positive for a respiratory virus, of these 32% were positive for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), and 27% were positive for influenza viruses (half of which were subtyped as pandemic H1N1 virus).   In Europe, overall influenza activity remained low with very low level co-circulation of pandemic and seasonal influenza type B viruses. The overall proportion of sentinel respiratory samples testing positive for influenza remained stable at about 5.3%; and the total number of sentinel influenza B virus detections continued to exceed that of influenza A viruses, primarily due to low level seasonal influenza type B virus circulation in the Russian Federation and Kazakhstan.   The Global Influenza Surveillance Network (GISN) continues monitoring the global circulation of influenza viruses, including pandemic, seasonal and other influenza viruses infecting, or with the potential to infect, humans including seasonal influenza.

The case, along with three travel companions, visited rural areas and game reserves along the coast of Eastern Cape and Western Cape provinces. On 7 April 2010, the case developed symptoms including fever, headache and a rash (exanthema). Almost concurrently a similar illness was reported in her travel companions. German health authorities are currently investigating the circumstances around infection in the confirmed case.   As of 3 May 2010, the Department of Health of South Africa has reported 172 cases, including 15 deaths since the beginning of the outbreak in Free State Province, Eastern Cape Province, Northern Cape Province,  Western Cape, and North West Province. While it is reported that most of these cases have had direct contact with RVF-infected livestock and/or are epidemiologically linked to farms with confirmed animal cases of RVF, there are a number of cases in which the route of transmission is currently unknown. Exposure to infected mosquitoes in these cases cannot be currently ruled out.   The Government of South Africa has implemented public health control measures which include development of key risk reduction messages for at risk population and health worker guidelines for case identification and reporting, laboratory investigations, clinical case management, hospital infection control and the public health measures for prevention and control and animal vaccination in non-affected areas.   WHO advises no international travel restriction to or from South Africa. However, WHO recommends that visitors to South Africa, especially those intending to visit farms and/or game reserves, avoid coming into contact with animal tissues or blood, avoid drinking unpasteurized or uncooked milk or eating raw meat. All travellers should take appropriate precautions against mosquito bites (use of mosquito nets, insect repellents). Travel medicine professionals and travel medicine services should be aware of the current RVF situation in South Africa in order to provide advice and care accordingly.

WHO is actively monitoring the progress of the pandemic through frequent consultations with the WHO Regional Offices and Member States and through monitoring of multiple sources of information.  Situation update:   The current situation is largely unchanged since the last update. The most active areas of transmission of pandemic influenza H1N1 virus continue to be parts of West and Central Africa with some focal areas of activity in South and Southeast Asia. Pandemic influenza activity H1N1 remains low in much of the temperate areas of both the northern and southern hemispheres. Seasonal influenza type B virus is the predominant influenza virus, though also at low levels of circulation, across East Asia, Northern and Eastern Europe. Influenza type B viruses have also been detected in Central Africa and this week in West Africa. Seasonal influenza H3N2 viruses have continued to be detected in South and Southeast Asia, as well as sporadically in some countries of West and Central Africa, and Eastern Europe.   In Sub-Saharan Africa, data from a limited number of countries suggests that active transmission of pandemic influenza H1N1 virus is declining across West and West-central Africa.  Ghana is reporting moderate amounts of pandemic virus (16 % of all clinical specimens tested were positive for pandemic influenza) but smaller numbers of cases continue to be detected in Senegal, Niger and Cameroon. In East Africa, influenza activity has returned to low levels. Only Rwanda has detected small numbers of pandemic virus in the past week. In addition, a few seasonal influenza H3N2 viruses are seen in Ghana.  Influenza type B has been increasingly detected in the area, notably in Ghana and Cameroon.   In East Asia, pandemic influenza H1N1 virus circulation is now sporadic. In China, Mongolia, and Republic of Korea most influenza like illness cases continued to be primarily due to seasonal influenza type B viruses. In China and Mongolia influenza detections have continued to decline compared to previous recent weeks. The Republic of Korea reported increasing levels of respiratory disease activity associated with increasing detections of seasonal influenza type B in respiratory specimens over five consecutive weeks.  Of note, small numbers of pandemic influenza H1N1, seasonal H3N2 and H1N1 viruses continued to be sporadically detected in some countries of the region.   In Southeast Asia, overall levels of influenza activity were low.  Although the predominant influenza virus circulating was still pandemic influenza H1N1, there was co-circulation of seasonal influenza type B and, to a lesser extent, H3N2 viruses in several countries including Singapore, Cambodia, Indonesia and Thailand. Malaysia has reported increasing levels of respiratory diseases activity associated with pandemic influenza H1N1 laboratory confirmed cases.  Media sources have also reported school closures in the country. In Singapore, influenza-like-illness levels are still below the seasonal epidemic threshold but have increased compared to previous week.   In South Asia, Bangladesh reported an increase in respiratory diseases activity associated with increasing numbers of pandemic influenza H1N1 laboratory confirmed cases since beginning of April. India reported pandemic influenza activity in the states of Maharashtra and recently Karnataka. Levels of respiratory diseases activity in both of these countries appear much less intense than in the initial wave of transmission which occurred late 2009.  Although pandemic influenza is the predominant virus circulating in the region, seasonal influenza type B viruses continued to be detected in Iran and Bangladesh.   In the tropical zone of the Americas, limited data suggested that pandemic influenza H1N1 activity remains low but with a few localized areas of transmission. Jamaica, Panama and Guatemala, reported increasing trends in respiratory disease activity. In Cuba, all provinces reported an increase in numbers of acute respiratory diseases cases in the last two weeks, mainly from the city of Havana. In Peru, the number of pneumonia cases in children under 5 years of age in Lima has been increasing since six consecutive weeks and remained above the epidemic threshold. However, the extent to which these pneumonia cases have been due to pandemic influenza H1N1 virus is not known.  Notably, respiratory syncitial virus (RSV) has been reported to be circulating in the area.   In the temperate zone of the Northern Hemisphere, overall pandemic influenza H1N1 activity remained low. In United States, the proportion of outpatient visits for influenza-like illness was below the national baseline.  No influenza B is reported by countries of North America. In Europe, pandemic influenza activity is at very low intensity in all countries. The overall proportion of sentinel respiratory samples testing positive for influenza remained stable at about 4.5%. For the current week, the total number of sentinel influenza B detections continued to exceed that of influenza A, mainly due to viral detections from Eastern Europe: Central, Siberian, Far Eastern regions of the Russian Federation and Kazakhstan.   In the temperate countries of the Southern Hemisphere, influenza-like illness activity remained low and at the levels experienced at the same time in previous years. Australia has continued to report sporadic detections of pandemic influenza H1N1, seasonal influenza B and H3N2 viruses in low numbers in recent weeks.

This represents the first importation of poliovirus in the WHO European Region since it was certified polio-free in 2002.   As of 21 April 2010, 120 cases of acute flaccid paralysis had been reported from Tajikistan. The majority of these have onset of paralysis within the past 2 weeks, prompting the Government to notify WHO of an outbreak. Ten of the children have died. The vast majority of the cases are children 45% had four or more doses of oral polio vaccine.   To date, poliovirus type 1 has been isolated in diagnostic specimens from 7 of these cases. All cases are in the south-west of the country, in an area bordering Afghanistan and Uzbekistan. Afghanistan is one of the four remaining polio-endemic countries. No cases have been reported in the areas of Afghanistan bordering Tajikistan.   The Government of Tajikistan has requested technical guidance and support from WHO. Vaccine for three outbreak response rounds is being pre-positioned by UNICEF Supply Division for Tajikistan.   Tajikistan's last case of clinically confirmed polio was in 1997; the last case of polio confirmed by virological testing was in 1991. Reported OPV3 coverage nationwide was 87% in 2008, the last year for which complete data are available under the WHO/UNICEF joint reporting process. AFP surveillance indicators in Tajikistan meet certification standards at the national level.  In 2009, Tajikistan reported 35 cases of acute flaccid paralysis, of which none were caused by wild poliovirus. Globally, more than 90,000 cases of acute flaccid paralysis were reported in 2009, of which 1606 were caused by wild poliovirus.   Three cases of acute flaccid paralysis have been reported in Uzbekistan on the Tajikistan border; poliovirus has not been isolated yet in laboratory testing.

"2010","http://www.who.int/csr/don/2010_04_23a/en/index.html"," Pandemic (H1N1) 2009 - update 97  Weekly update   23 April 2010 -  As of 18 April 2010, worldwide more than 214 countries and overseas territories or communities have reported laboratory confirmed cases of pandemic influenza H1N1 2009, including over 17853 deaths.   WHO is actively monitoring the progress of the pandemic through frequent consultations with the WHO Regional Offices and member states and through monitoring of multiple sources of information.  Situation update:   Summary: Currently the most active areas of transmission of pandemic influenza are in parts of West and Central Africa but transmission is also still occurring in South East Asia, and Central America. Pandemic influenza activity remains low in much of the temperate zone of both the northern and southern hemispheres. Seasonal influenza type B viruses have been increasingly detected over a larger area and are now the predominant circulating influenza viruses across East Asia, Central Africa and Northern and Eastern Europe. Very small numbers of type B viruses have also recently been detected in Central America. Seasonal influenza H3N2 is still being detected in South and Southeast Asia (mainly Indonesia), as well as sporadically in several countries of West Africa, and Eastern Europe.     In Europe, most countries reported a low intensity of respiratory diseases with only 6.8% of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza. This week the total number of influenza B virus detections continued to exceed that of influenza A, as in recent weeks, although at low levels. Of note, some sporadic detections of seasonal H1N1 and H3N2 viruses were reported in Eastern Europe.   In East Asia, very few pandemic influenza viruses are being detected. In China, Mongolia, and Republic of Korea most influenza like illness (ILI) cases are now due primarily to influenza type B viruses. In China, overall influenza activity continues to decline and no pandemic influenza virus was detected this week. In Mongolia, influenza type B virus continues to circulate but is declining since a recent peak. An increased trend of respiratory disease activity associated with increasing circulation of influenza type B viruses has been reported in the Republic of Korea during the past few weeks. Small numbers of seasonal influenza H1N1 and H3N2 viruses continue to be sporadically reported in some countries of the region.   In South and Southeast Asia, the most active areas of transmissions of pandemic influenza are in Malaysia, Singapore, and Thailand. Although pandemic influenza virus is the predominant circulating influenza virus in the region, influenza H3N2 and influenza type B continue to co-circulate in Singapore and Thailand and Indonesia. In Singapore, rates of influenza-like illness (ILI) and acute respiratory infections (ARI) increased compared to previous week but are still below the epidemic threshold.  In Indonesia, in contrast to other countries of the area, the predominant virus circulating continues to be influenza H3N2, with few detections of influenza type B and pandemic influenza viruses. In Malaysia, an increase in the number of respiratory disease consultations due to influenza-like-illness (ILI) was reported in the majority of the states compared to previous week. In Bangladesh, a small but slightly increased (compared to the previous week) numbers of pandemic influenza cases continues to be detected.   Limited available data from North Africa suggests that respiratory disease activity there remains low.  In sub-Saharan Africa, available data suggests ongoing community transmission of pandemic influenza virus in West Africa. Transmission appears to have peaked in Senegal in February but Ghana continues to have active, though decreasing, transmission. Cote d`Ivoire and Niger reported increasing trends of respiratory disease activity but no virological data were available. In central Africa, low levels of pandemic influenza activity continue to be reported in Cameroon. In addition, small numbers of seasonal influenza H3N2 virus detections were reported by Angola. In eastern Africa, pandemic influenza virus continues to be detected in declining numbers in Rwanda with persistent reporting of small numbers of seasonal influenza H3N2 in Rwanda and Kenya. No increase in respiratory disease activity or detections of pandemic influenza viruses have yet been noted in Southern Africa. Influenza type B has been increasingly detected in some countries of central Africa.   In the tropical zone of the Americas, Ecuador, El Salvador and Guatemala, reported increases in respiratory diseases activity. In Guatemala, the number of respiratory disease consultations increased 80% compared to the previous week. Of note, co-circulation of other respiratory viruses, including respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), parainfluenza, and adenovirus has been detected in addition to small numbers of pandemic influenza virus. In Mexico, during early April 2010, the sentinel surveillance system reported a 38.6% decrease in the number of influenza-like-illness (ILI) and severe acute respiratory illness (SARI) cases compared to the previous week.   In the temperate zone of the southern hemisphere, Chile reported regional increases in ILI activity for the past four weeks.  While the national ILI levels remain below the epidemic threshold, in Los Lagos, Tarapacá, and in some southern regions, the ILI level is above epidemic threshold. For the most recent reporting week, 6.8% of sentinel surveillance samples tested positive for respiratory viruses. Of these, 52.9% for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), 23.5% for adenovirus, and 11.8% were positive for pandemic influenza virus. In Australia and New Zealand, there is no evidence yet of the start of winter-time community transmission of influenza viruses.  Australia has had sporadic detections of pandemic H1N1 viruses and seasonal influenza type B viruses in low numbers.

"2010","http://www.who.int/csr/don/2010_04_16/en/index.html"," Pandemic (H1N1) 2009 - update 96  Weekly update   16 April 2010 -  As of 11 April 2010, worldwide more than 214 countries and overseas territories or communities have reported laboratory confirmed cases of pandemic influenza H1N1 2009, including over 17798 deaths.   WHO is actively monitoring the progress of the pandemic through frequent consultations with the WHO Regional Offices and member states and through monitoring of multiple sources of information.  Situation update:   The most active areas of pandemic influenza virus transmission currently are in parts of the tropical zones of the Americas, West Africa, Eastern Africa and South East Asia. Although pandemic influenza continues to be the predominant circulating influenza virus worldwide, seasonal influenza type B virus circulation continues to be predominant in East Asia, and is being detected across other parts of Asia, and Europe at low levels. Sporadic detections of seasonal influenza H3N2 viruses have been reported across Asia, Eastern Europe and Eastern Africa most notably in recent weeks in Indonesia and Tanzania. Few seasonal H1N1 viruses were reported in the Russian Federation and Northern China in the last week.   In East Asia, pandemic influenza activity continued to decline and is now at very low levels.  The predominant virus associated with influenza-like-illness in the area is now influenza type B viruses, which continue to circulate in China, Mongolia, and Republic of Korea. The Republic of Korea reports an increasing trend of respiratory disease activity associated with detections of influenza type B viruses and small numbers of pandemic H1N1. In China, outbreaks of acute respiratory infections associated with B virus detections are reported but none due to pandemic H1N1. The overall level of respiratory disease activity is similar to the level observed during the same period of 2007-2008 and 2008-2009 seasons. Small numbers of seasonal H3N2 and sporadic seasonal H1N1 viruses were detected in Northern China. In Mongolia, rates of influenza-like illness (ILI) continue to decline and are associated with influenza type B only.   In South and Southeast Asia, the most active areas of influenza transmission are Thailand and Singapore, where pandemic H1N1 is the dominant influenza virus, with co-circulation at lower levels of influenza type B and H3N2. Overall, the intensity of transmission is relatively low.  In Thailand, respiratory disease activity has decreased since the previous week. Four percent of sentinel respiratory samples from ILI patients and 2.6% of sentinel respiratory samples from hospitalized patients with pneumonia were found to be positive for pandemic H1N1. Malaysia continues to report occasional outbreaks of respiratory disease in three states, Johor, Pahang, and Melaka. Only Melaka state has reported pandemic H1N1 laboratory confirmed cases, with 4 cases treated in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU). In India overall pandemic H1N1 activity is very low in most states, although in western India pandemic H1N1 cases continue to be reported in low numbers.   In Europe, pandemic influenza activity has continued to decrease in recent weeks and is at very low intensity in all countries. The overall proportion of sentinel respiratory samples testing positive for influenza remained low (5.4%), and the number of influenza type B virus detections exceeded that of influenza A.  In Italy, 50% (7/14) of sentinel respiratory samples tested positive for influenza, all of which were seasonal influenza type B viruses.   In the northern temperate zones of the Americas, overall pandemic influenza transmission remained low as pandemic influenza H1N1 virus continues to circulate at very low levels in some areas. In temperate countries of the southern hemisphere, overall respiratory disease activity remained low.   In tropical zone of the Americas, limited data suggests that overall influenza activity remains low with localized areas of active transmission in a number of countries. In Cuba, a slight increase of confirmed cases of pandemic virus was reported during the most recent reporting week. In Mexico, available data suggests that localized active transmission of pandemic influenza virus continues to occur around Mexico City but is very low nationally. In Peru, the number of pneumonia cases has increased over the last 2 weeks, especially in children less than 5 years of age, however there is no virological information available to indicate the cause of these cases.  The lack of an associated increase in other age groups may indicate a cause other than influenza. Increased levels of ILI have also been reported across much of Brazil over the previous two weeks particularly in northern Brazil.   In North Africa limited available data suggests that respiratory disease activity remained low. In sub-Saharan Africa, West Africa continues to see community transmission of pandemic influenza virus with Ghana currently being the primary focus of transmission (45% of all clinical specimens tested were positive for pandemic influenza) but smaller numbers of cases were also seen in Senegal and Niger. Pandemic influenza virus transmission appears to have peaked in Senegal approximately one month ago.  Guinea has now reported their first cases of pandemic H1N1. In East Africa, cases of pandemic influenza H1N1 continue to be detected in Rwanda, though in declining numbers. Small numbers of seasonal influenza H3N2 and influenza type B viruses were detected during the last week in Rwanda, Kenya and South Africa. Notably, Tanzania has also recently reported significant transmission of seasonal influenza H3N2.  No increases in respiratory disease activity or pandemic influenza have yet been noted in South Africa.   In the South pacific, Vanuatu and Nauru reported an increasing trend of respiratory diseases activity for this week, but this trend was not associated with laboratory confirmed detections of pandemic H1N1 virus.   In other temperate countries out of the southern hemisphere, Australia and New Zealand, influenza activity continues to be low, with mostly detections of pandemic H1N1 and sporadic seasonal influenza viruses.   The Global Influenza Surveillance Network (GISN) continues monitoring the global circulation of influenza viruses, including pandemic, seasonal and other influenza viruses infecting, or with the potential to infect, humans including seasonal influenza.

"2010","http://www.who.int/csr/don/2010_04_09/en/index.html"," Pandemic (H1N1) 2009 - update 95  Weekly update   9 April 2010 -  As of 4 April 2010, worldwide more than 213 countries and overseas territories or communities have reported laboratory confirmed cases of pandemic influenza H1N1 2009, including over 17700 deaths.   WHO is actively monitoring the progress of the pandemic through frequent consultations with the WHO Regional Offices and member states and through monitoring of multiple sources of information.  Situation update:   The current situation is largely unchanged since the last update. The most active areas of pandemic influenza virus transmission continue to be in parts of Southeast Asia, West Africa, and in the tropical zone of the Americas. In Chile, a country of the southern hemisphere temperate zone, there is evidence of early localized pandemic influenza virus transmission in advance of the usual start of the southern hemisphere winter influenza season. Seasonal influenza type B viruses continue to actively circulate in East Asia, but are also being detected at low levels across other parts of Asia and Europe.   In Southeast Asia, the most active transmission of pandemic influenza virus continues to be in Thailand, however, overall disease activity has declined substantially since peaking during late February 2009. During the most recent reporting week, 6.7% and 16% of sentinel respiratory samples from outpatients with ILI and patients hospitalized with pneumonia, respectively, were positive for pandemic influenza. Low levels of seasonal influenza H3N2 and type B viruses have also been detected in Thailand in recent weeks. In Malaysia, limited data suggests that recent pandemic influenza activity may be declining with fewer detections of new cases. In Indonesia, recent low level circulation of seasonal influenza H3N2 viruses appears to be subsiding.   In South Asia, limited data suggests the most active areas of pandemic influenza virus transmission continues to be in Bangladesh, where an increasing number of cases have detected since late February 2009. Overall pandemic influenza activity remained low across the rest of the subcontinent with persistence of low level circulation of pandemic influenza virus in western India.   In East Asia, pandemic influenza virus continues to circulate at very low levels as overall rates of respiratory diseases remained low across much of the region. In China, overall rates of ILI remained at expected seasonal levels while most current influenza activity was due to circulating seasonal influenza type B viruses (accounting for >90% influenza virus detections).  In Mongolia, rates of ILI continued to decline after a recent peak of influenza activity associated with circulation of seasonal influenza type B viruses. Although overall rates of ILI and detections of influenza virus remain low in the Republic of Korea, Hong Kong SAR (China), and Chinese Taipei, an increasing proportion of virus isolates in recent weeks have been seasonal influenza type B viruses.   In Sub-Saharan Africa, limited data suggests that active circulation of pandemic influenza virus continues across parts of West and west-central Africa, and to a lesser extent in limited areas of East Africa. During early to mid-March 2009, 23% of respiratory sample tested positive for influenza in both Cote d'Ivoire and Ghana (the majority of virus isolates were pandemic H1N1).  In Senegal, pandemic influenza transmission remains active but may be declining as the rate of sentinel specimens testing positive for pandemic influenza fell from a peak of 67% during early February 2009 to 17% during the most recent reporting week. In Cameroon, 38% (13/34) of respiratory samples tested positive for influenza during the past two weeks, of which 71% were pandemic and 29% were seasonal influenza type B viruses. Localized areas of active pandemic influenza transmission persist in areas of Eastern Africa, particularly Rwanda and Tanzania. Pandemic influenza virus continues to be the predominant influenza virus circulating in West and East Africa, however, small numbers of seasonal influenza H3N2 viruses have also been identified.   In Europe, low levels of pandemic influenza virus continue circulate across limited areas of Europe. The overall proportion of sentinel respiratory samples testing positive for influenza remained low (6.2%); the total number of sentinel influenza type B virus detections exceeded that of pandemic influenza virus during the most recent reporting week.  In Italy, 31% (9/29) of sentinel respiratory samples tested positive for influenza, all of which were seasonal influenza type B viruses. Most countries in the region reported a low intensity of respiratory diseases, and only Georgia reported geographically widespread influenza activity.   In tropical zone of the Americas, limited data suggests that overall influenza activity remains low but variable with localized areas of active transmission in several countries, including in Cuba, Guatemala, Peru, and Bolivia, all of which reported an increasing trend of respiratory diseases in association with localized to regional spread of influenza activity in at least one of the two recent reporting weeks. In Mexico, limited data suggests that localized active transmission of pandemic influenza virus continued to occur in several states throughout March 2010, particularly in parts of the Federal District which have reported recent increases in the number of severe and fatal pandemic H1N1 virus infections. In Brazil, increased levels of sentinel ILI have been reported across much of Brazil over the past month, however, most recent reports of severe and fatal illness due to pandemic influenza virus infection have been from the northern region.   In the northern temperate zones of the Americas, overall pandemic influenza transmission remained low as influenza virus continues to circulate at very low levels. In the United States, overall levels of ILI remained below the national baseline and were only slightly elevated above the regional baseline in the southwestern region (although this regional increase was not associated with increased sentinel detections of pandemic or other influenza viruses). The most active areas of pandemic influenza transmission in the United States currently appears to be in three southeastern states, all of which reported regional spread of influenza activity.   In  temperate countries of the southern hemisphere, overall influenza activity remained low, with mostly sporadic detections of pandemic and seasonal influenza viruses. Of note, Chile has reported new detections of pandemic virus, including small numbers of severe cases, in at least three regions over the past two weeks; the significance of this early limited circulation of pandemic virus in advance of the usual winter influenza season is not yet known.   Sporadic detections of seasonal influenza H3N2 viruses continued to be reported across Asia, Africa, Australia, and the Americas, however, the most active (but overall low) circulation of seasonal H3N2 viruses has been reported in Indonesia.   The Global Influenza Surveillance Network (GISN) continues monitoring the global circulation of influenza viruses, including pandemic, seasonal and other influenza viruses infecting, or with the potential to infect, humans including seasonal influenza.

So far, seven districts have crossed the epidemic threshold (Bébidja, Bédjondo, Béré, Doba, Dono-Manga, Goundi and Laï) while three others crossed the alert threshold (Bénoye, Laokassi and Sarh).   Sixty seven specimens of cerebral spinal fluid have been found positive for Neisseria meningitidis serogroup A by latex test while 14  specimens were found positive for Neisseria meningitidis serogroup W135, by latex, and culture. This indicates that some areas are experiencing mixed epidemics (Dono-Manga), while others are being predominantly affected by either serogroup A (Doba, Bébidja district ) or serogroup W135 (Goundi district).   The International Coordinating Group (ICG) on Vaccine Provision for Epidemic Meningitis Control has provided 157,000 doses of trivalent ACW vaccine for a mass vaccination campaign in affected areas of Dono-Manga and Goundi as well as 282,000 doses of bivalent vaccine for mass vaccination in Doba and Bebidja. Vaccines are being provided with the  support of the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization (GAVI). Vaccination campaigns have been completed or are being conducted in Bébidja and Doba district, while others will take place shortly in Dono-Manga and Goundi districts.   WHO, UNICEF, Médecins sans Frontières and the International Federation of Red Cross (IFRC) are working with the Ministry of Health, Chad to implement the vaccination campaigns as well as other emergency control measures, including case management and surveillance in neighbouring districts.

WHO is actively monitoring the progress of the pandemic through frequent consultations with the WHO Regional Offices and member states and through monitoring of multiple sources of information.  Situation update:   The most active areas of pandemic influenza virus transmission currently are in parts of the tropical zones of Asia, the Americas, and Africa. Pandemic influenza activity remains low in much of the temperate areas of both the northern and southern hemispheres. Although pandemic influenza virus continues to be the predominant influenza virus circulating worldwide, seasonal influenza type B viruses are predominant in much of East Asia, and have been increasingly detected at low levels across southeast and western Asia, East Africa, and in parts of eastern and northern Europe. Seasonal influenza A (H3N2) is still being detected in very small numbers in parts of Asia and Australia.   In Southeast Asia, pandemic influenza virus transmission remains active but variable across the region. Thailand continues to report the most active circulation of pandemic virus in the region, however, disease activity may have recently peaked and begun to decline. Approximately half of all provinces in Thailand reported that >10% outpatient visits were due to influenza like illness (ILI). The proportion of outpatient sentinel respiratory samples testing positive for influenza dropped to 10% after peaking at approximately 30% during mid February 2010. In Malaysia, limited data suggest pandemic influenza virus transmission persists as new cases continue to be reported. In Indonesia, no recent pandemic influenza activity has been reported, however, low levels of seasonal influenza H3N2 and type B viruses continue to be detected. In Myanmar, limited data suggest that pandemic influenza has declined substantially since a period of active transmission during February 2010.   In South Asia, overall pandemic influenza activity remains low, except in Bangladesh, which reported regional spread of pandemic influenza virus in association with an increase in new cases since late February 2010. In India, low level circulation of pandemic influenza virus persists in the western part of the country.   In East Asia, overall pandemic influenza activity remained low as circulation of seasonal influenza B viruses continued to increase across the region. In China, ILI activity has greatly decreased; however, approximately 20-30% of respiratory samples have tested positive for influenza in recent weeks.  Of these, over 85% were seasonal influenza B viruses. In Mongolia, recent intense influenza activity due to seasonal influenza B viruses continues to decrease. Overall rates of ILI have returned to near baseline in both Japan and the Republic of Korea as pandemic influenza virus circulation continues to wane. Seasonal influenza B viruses are circulating at low level across other parts of East and Southeast Asia and Oceania (Hong Kong SAR (China), Japan, Republic of Korea, Chinese Taipei, Philippine, Thailand, Vietnam, Indonesia, Bangladesh and Australia). Also, small numbers of seasonal influenza H3N2 viruses have been detected in several countries of East and Southeast Asia as well as Oceania, particularly in Indonesia and in Australia.   In North Africa and Western Asia, limited data suggests that pandemic influenza virus continues to circulate at low levels, as overall disease activity remained low across much of the region. In Iran, no pandemic influenza viruses have been detected recently, however, low levels of seasonal influenza B viruses continue to be detected.   In Sub-Saharan Africa, limited data suggests that pandemic influenza virus transmission remains variable but most active in western Africa and in limited areas of eastern Africa.  Localized areas of active pandemic influenza transmission persist in areas of Eastern Africa, particularly Rwanda and Tanzania. Pandemic influenza virus continues to be the predominant influenza virus circulating in West and East Africa, however, small numbers of seasonal influenza H3N2, H1N1, and seasonal influenza B viruses have also been identified.   In tropical zone of the Americas, limited data suggests that overall influenza activity remains low but variable with localized areas of active transmission in a number of countries. Guatemala, Nicaragua, El Salvador, Panama, Brazil, Peru, and Bolivia, all reported an increasing trend of respiratory diseases associated with circulation of pandemic influenza virus for at least one week during March 2010. Localized increases in pandemic influenza activity have been associated with school outbreaks in several countries; however, in some places disease activity may be partially accounted for by co-circulation of other respiratory viruses. The most active area of pandemic influenza virus circulation in the region appears to be in Brazil where disease activity in the northern region has been associated with pandemic influenza virus transmission.  In Mexico, limited data suggests that localized active transmission of pandemic influenza virus continued to occur in several states throughout March 2010, although overall influenza activity did not increase to peak levels observed during fall influenza season.   In the northern and the southern temperate zones of the Americas, overall pandemic influenza transmission remained low as influenza virus continues to circulate at low levels. Although the national level of ILI activity remained below the seasonal baseline in the United States, three of ten subregions reported a resurgence of ILI activity above their respective baselines. The most active areas of pandemic influenza transmission currently appears to be in the southeastern United States, particularly in the states of Alabama, Georgia, and South Carolina, all of which reported regional spread of influenza activity. A corresponding increase in confirmed severe cases of pandemic H1N1 has also been noted in the southeastern United States in recent weeks.  In Canada, overall ILI activity remained below the seasonal baseline.  In temperate countries of the southern hemisphere, overall influenza activity remained low, with sporadic detections of pandemic and seasonal influenza viruses.   In Europe, low levels of pandemic influenza virus continue to circulate across the region, particularly across southern and eastern Europe. The proportion of sentinel respiratory samples testing positive for influenza remained low (4.6%). Three countries (Latvia, Lithuania and Bulgaria) reported an increasing trend of respiratory diseases activity, however, these trends have not been associated with increased detections of pandemic influenza virus. Increased circulation of seasonal influenza B virus has been observed in the Siberian and far eastern regions of the Russian Federation, and in Italy and Sweden, where it continues to be the predominant circulating virus (although at overall low levels).   The Global Influenza Surveillance Network (GISN) continues monitoring the global circulation of influenza viruses, including pandemic, seasonal and other influenza viruses infecting, or with the potential to infect, humans including seasonal influenza.

"2010","http://www.who.int/csr/don/2010_03_26/en/index.html"," Pandemic (H1N1) 2009 - update 93  Weekly update   26 March 2010 -  As of 21 March 2010, worldwide more than 213 countries and overseas territories or communities have reported laboratory confirmed cases of pandemic influenza H1N1 2009, including over 16,931 deaths.   WHO is actively monitoring the progress of the pandemic through frequent consultations with the WHO Regional Offices and member states and through monitoring of multiple sources of information.  Situation update:   The most active areas of pandemic influenza virus transmission currently are in parts of Southeast Asia, West Africa, and in the tropical zone of the Americas. After a period of sustained pandemic influenza transmission in Thailand over the past two months, overall activity now appears to be decreasing. In West Africa, limited data suggests that active transmission of pandemic influenza virus persists without clear evidence of a peak in activity. In Central America and in the tropical zone of South America, an increasing trend of respiratory disease activity associated with circulation of pandemic influenza virus has been reported since early March 2010 in an increasing number of countries. Although pandemic influenza virus continues to be the predominant influenza virus circulating worldwide, seasonal influenza B viruses are predominate in East Asia, and have been increasingly detected at low levels across southeast and western Asia, eastern Africa, and in parts of Europe.   In Southeast Asia, pandemic influenza virus transmission has remained active and geographically widespread in Thailand since mid February 2010 and has been increasing since early March in Malaysia. In Thailand, the overall intensity of respiratory disease activity was reported to be low to moderate, and activity now appears to decreasing since mid March 2009; 10-22% of sentinel respiratory samples from patients with ILI tested positive for pandemic influenza during the most recent reporting week. In Malaysia, limited data suggests increasing detections of pandemic H1N1 cases over the past two weeks, although the extent and severity of illness is not currently known. Low numbers of seasonal influenza B viruses continue to be isolated in Thailand and in other parts of Southeast Asia.   In South Asia, pandemic influenza virus transmission remains variable across the subcontinent. In Bangladesh, an increasing trend in respiratory disease activity and increasing detections of H1N1 cases has been reported since late February 2010; however, overall intensity of disease activity remains low. In India, although overall pandemic influenza activity remains low, pandemic H1N1 cases continue be reported in Western India.   In East Asia, pandemic influenza virus transmission has declined substantially. Rates of ILI/ARI have returned to near baseline in Japan and Republic of Korea. In China, although overall ILI and pandemic influenza virus circulation has decreased substantially, circulation of seasonal influenza B viruses continues to be active (accounting for ~85% of all influenza viruses isolated during recent weeks). Similarly, in Mongolia, after experiencing a first peak of ILI activity due to circulation of pandemic influenza virus during November 2009, a second recent sharp peak of ILI activity occurred during late February and early March 2010 exclusively as a result circulating seasonal influenza B viruses. Overall influenza activity continues to remain low in Hong Kong SAR (China), Chinese Taipei, and DPR Korea.   In Sub-Saharan Africa, pandemic influenza activity remains variable. Limited data suggest that the most active areas of pandemic influenza virus transmission continue to be in West Africa and in limited areas of East Africa, particularly in Rwanda. Twenty-seven percent of respiratory specimens in Ghana, and 47% of specimens in Rwanda, tested positive for pandemic influenza virus during mid March 2010.  In Senegal, a high intensity of respiratory diseases activity was reported in association with increased detections of pandemic influenza virus. Pandemic influenza virus continues to be the predominant influenza virus circulating in West and East Africa, however, small numbers of seasonal influenza H3N2 and seasonal influenza B viruses have also been identified.   In tropical zone of the Americas overall influenza activity remains low, however, active transmission of pandemic influenza virus may be increasing, particularly across Central America and parts of South America. An increasing trend of respiratory diseases activity associated with detections of pandemic influenza virus was reported in Guatemala, Nicaragua, El Salvador, and Panama. In Brazil, three consecutive weeks of increases in respiratory diseases activity have been associated with regional spread of pandemic influenza virus; three states in northern Brazil reported increases in detections of confirmed cases, however, the extent and severity of cases is not yet know. In Mexico, two weeks of increases (11-14% per week) in ILI and SARI were reported during late February and early March 2010, however, the extent to which respiratory disease activity has been due to pandemic influenza virus is not yet known.   In Europe, overall pandemic influenza virus transmission continued to decline or remain low in most countries. Of note, over 20% of sentinel specimens in Germany, Italy, and the Russian Federation tested positive for influenza, however, these increased sentinel detections of influenza virus were not associated with significant increases in overall rates of acute respiratory illness; in Italy and the Russian Federation, seasonal influenza B viruses were either dominant or co-dominant with pandemic H1N1, respectively. In Romania and in Poland, recent increases in rates of ILI or ARI have not been associated with increased detections of pandemic or other influenza viruses.   In North Africa and Western Asia, limited data suggests that pandemic influenza virus continues to circulate at low levels, as overall disease activity remained low across much of the region.   In the northern and the southern temperate zones of the Americas, overall pandemic influenza transmission remained low as influenza virus continues to circulate at low levels.   In the temperate zone of the southern hemisphere, overall influenza activity remained low, with sporadic detections of pandemic and seasonal influenza viruses.

Situation update:   The most active areas of pandemic influenza transmission continue to be in Southeast Asia and West Africa. Limited data suggests that pandemic influenza activity may be increasing across parts of Central America and the Caribbean. Low levels of pandemic influenza virus continue to circulate across southern and south-eastern Europe and in East, West, and South Asia. Although pandemic influenza virus continues to be the predominant influenza virus circulating worldwide, seasonal influenza B viruses are predominate in East Asia, and have been detected at low levels across southeast Asia and eastern Africa.   In south and southeast Asia, the most active areas of pandemic influenza transmission continue to be in Thailand; over the past month approximately 25-30% of sentinel respiratory samples from patients with ILI and 10-35% of sentinel respiratory samples from hospitalized patients with pneumonia tested positive for influenza (predominantly pandemic H1N1, but also small numbers of seasonal B viruses). Recent pandemic influenza activity in Thailand, while associated with severe and fatal illness, does not appear to exceed activity observed during an earlier period of peak transmission between June and September 2009. In Myanmar, respiratory disease activity may be declining after a period of increased activity associated with increased detection of pandemic H1N1 cases during February 2010. In Bangladesh, an increasing trend in respiratory diseases activity was reported for the past two weeks in association with increased numbers of confirmed cases and increased geographical spread of pandemic influenza virus. In India, low level of pandemic influenza virus continues to circulate in western India.   In East Asia, pandemic influenza activity continued to decline substantially as rates of illness returned to baseline or remained low in Japan, Republic of Korea, Hong Kong (SAR), and Chinese Taipei. In China, pandemic influenza activity has waned substantially, however, influenza type B viruses continue to circulate. In Mongolia, a recent sharp increase in ILI activity was associated almost exclusively with increased circulation of influenza B viruses. In addition, increasing but low levels of circulation of seasonal influenza B viruses has been observed across other parts of East and Southeast Asia (Japan, Republic of Korea, Chinese Taipei, the Philippines, Thailand, Vietnam, Indonesia, Bangladesh). Small numbers of seasonal H3N2 viruses have also been detected in several countries of East and Southeast Asia.   In West Africa, limited data suggest that active transmission of pandemic influenza virus remains sustained across much of the region without clear evidence of a peak in activity. In Ghana, 38% of respiratory specimens collected during the past week tested positive for influenza, and of these, approximately 70% were pandemic H1N1. Limited sentinel surveillance data from Nigeria suggest that levels of ILI have increased over the past two months in conjunction with increased detections of pandemic influenza H1N1 virus. Localized outbreaks of pandemic H1N1 influenza have also been recently reported in parts of East Africa, particularly in Rwanda.  Pandemic influenza virus continues to be the predominant influenza virus circulating in West and East Africa, however, small numbers of seasonal H3N2 and seasonal B viruses have also been identified.   In tropical zone of the Americas, particularly in Central America and the Caribbean, limited data suggest that pandemic influenza virus transmission may be active. Geographically regional to widespread pandemic influenza activity was reported across Central America and the Caribbean with mixed trends in the pattern of respiratory diseases activity (increasing activity in Jamaica, Bahamas, Nicaragua, Panama; and decreasing activity in Costa Rica, Guatemala). Honduras continues to report several outbreaks of respiratory disease in schools with limited laboratory confirmation of pandemic influenza virus infection. In Brazil, over the past two weeks, an increasing trend of respiratory diseases with low overall intensity was reported in association with regional spread of influenza virus.   In North Africa and Western Asia, limited data suggests that pandemic influenza virus continues to circulate at low levels across the region. An increasing trend of respiratory diseases activity in association with regional spread of influenza was reported for past three weeks in Afghanistan and the past two weeks in Iraq; however, overall intensity of activity remains low to moderate in both countries.  Localized to regional spread of pandemic was also reported in Morocco, Libyan Arab Jamahiriya, Egypt, Jordan, Yemen, and Oman.   In Europe, overall pandemic influenza transmission continued to decline as low levels of pandemic virus continue to circulate in parts of eastern and south-eastern Europe. The overall percentage of sentinel respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza remained low (5.1%). Pandemic H1N1 2009 virus continues to be the predominant circulating influenza virus in the European region, except in Sweden and the Russian Federation, where seasonal influenza B viruses have been reported as co-dominant or dominant.   In the northern and the southern temperate zones of the Americas, overall pandemic influenza transmission remained low as influenza virus continued to circulate at low levels.

WHO is actively monitoring the progress of the pandemic through frequent consultations with the WHO Regional Offices and member states and through monitoring of multiple sources of information.  Situation update:   The most active areas of pandemic influenza transmission are currently in Southeast Asia, however, lower levels of pandemic virus circulation persist in other parts of Asia and in Eastern and South-eastern Europe. In West Africa, limited data suggests that pandemic influenza virus transmission may be increasing in region. Of note, seasonal influenza B viruses have been increasingly detected in Asia and appear to be spreading westward.   In Sub-Saharan Africa, limited data suggests that on-going community transmission of pandemic influenza virus continues to increase in parts of West Africa, without clear evidence of a peak in activity. Increased detections of pandemic influenza virus have been observed among sentinel surveillance sites in several countries, including Senegal and Cote D'Ivoire, however, to date, data is limited regarding the spectrum of clinical severity of cases. Recent increases in influenza activity have also been reported in Rwanda. Much of eastern and southern Africa likely experienced an earlier peak in pandemic influenza activity during November 2009 and late summer 2009, respectively.   In South and Southeast Asia, pandemic influenza virus circulation persist in most countries, however, overall transmission remains most active in Thailand, especially since mid January 2010. Approximately half of all provinces in Thailand reported that greater than 10% of all outpatients sought care for ILI, and approximately 25% of all patients with ILI at sentinel sites tested positive for influenza. The current increase in the number of cases in Thailand remains well below an earlier period of peak transmission during June through September 2009. In Bangladesh, an increasing trend in respiratory disease was reported, however, overall influenza activity remains low. In India, influenza virus transmission persist at lower levels in the western region of India, while activity in other regions has largely subsided.   In East Asia, pandemic influenza activity continues to decrease or remain low as levels of ILI return to seasonal baselines in Japan and in the Republic of Korea. In Mongolia, a recent sharp increase in ILI activity was associated predominantly with a resurgence of circulation of seasonal influenza B viruses. In China, pandemic influenza activity has declined since peaking during November 2009, however, overall influenza activity remains elevated, largely due to an increase in the circulation of seasonal influenza B viruses.   In North Africa and Western Asia, overall pandemic influenza activity remains low in most places, with the exception of Iraq and Afghanistan, both of which reported regional spread of influenza with an increasing trend in respiratory diseases activity. In Afghanistan, a moderate impact on the healthcare system was reported in association with increased respiratory diseases activity. Although overall influenza activity remains low in Iran, all recent influenza virus detection have been due to seasonal influenza B viruses.   In Europe, overall pandemic influenza transmission continued to decline as low levels of pandemic virus continue to circulate in parts of eastern and south-eastern Europe. The overall percentage of sentinel respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza remained low (6.8%) but slightly increased compared to the previous week. Pandemic H1N1 2009 virus continues to be the predominant circulating influenza virus in the European region with the exception of the Russian Federation and Sweden where influenza B was reported as co-dominant or dominant.   In the northern and the southern temperate zones of the Americas, overall pandemic influenza transmission remained low as influenza virus continued to circulate at low levels. In Central America, Nicaragua and Honduras, reported slight increases in respiratory diseases activity, possibly due to an increase in school outbreaks; however, it is unclear to what extent the increases are associated with circulation of pandemic influenza virus. In Brazil, an increasing trend of respiratory diseases with low overall intensity was reported in association with regional spread of influenza virus. In the temperate zone of the southern hemisphere, overall influenza activity remained low, with sporadic detections of pandemic and seasonal influenza viruses. Although pandemic influenza virus continues to be the predominant circulating influenza virus worldwide, circulation of seasonal influenza B viruses continue to increase and spread across Asia,  parts of Eastern Europe, and Eastern Africa, but most notably in China, Mongolia, Iran and the Russian Federation.   The Global Influenza Surveillance Network (GISN) continues monitoring the global circulation of influenza viruses, including pandemic, seasonal and other influenza viruses infecting, or with the potential to infect, humans including seasonal influenza.

"2010","http://www.who.int/csr/don/2010_03_05/en/index.html"," Pandemic (H1N1) 2009 - update 90  Weekly update   5 March 2010 -  As of 28 February 2010, worldwide more than 213 countries and overseas territories or communities have reported laboratory confirmed cases of pandemic influenza H1N1 2009, including at least 16455 deaths.   WHO is actively monitoring the progress of the pandemic through frequent consultations with the WHO Regional Offices and member states and through monitoring of multiple sources of information.  Situation update:   Summary: In the temperate zone of the northern hemisphere, transmission of virus persists in some areas of Europe and Asia but influenza activity is declining and at low level in the most areas.   The most active areas of transmission are currently observed in parts of Southeast Asia and East and South-eastern Europe. Recently, influenza type B is increasingly reported in Asia.   Pandemic influenza virus continues to circulate in South and Southeast Asian countries. In Thailand, activity has increased and Myanmar continues to report regionally circulating pandemic virus. However, the overall intensity of activity nationally is still low in both countries. Respiratory disease activity is declining in all other countries of the area. In East Asia, transmission of pandemic influenza virus persists at low levels in most countries including Hong Kong SAR (China) and Chinese Taipei or has returned to baseline levels (Japan and the Republic of Korea).  Of note, seasonal influenza B virus activity has been increasing in the area and is now the predominant influenza virus in Mongolia, China, and parts of South East Asia.  Japan has also reported clusters of influenza B related cases.   In Australia and New Zealand, overall influenza activity remains low and at the levels experienced at the same time in previous years. No new cases of H1N1 influenza have been reported this week from the island nations of the South Pacific.   Influenza activity is low in Western Europe and has largely returned to baseline levels.  However, many countries of Eastern Europe (Russian Federation, Bulgaria, Armenia and Moldova) are still reporting some increased respiratory disease activity compared to their baselines. The percentage of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza decreased further in week 7 to around 3.5%.  The majority of those were positive for pandemic influenza and only a very few seasonal influenza H3N2 and influenza type B viruses were detected.   In the northern temperate zones of the Americas, pandemic influenza virus continues to circulate at very low levels yielding an overall low and declining pattern of pandemic influenza activity. However, in Mexico and Peru, there is a slight increase in respiratory disease activity, though the overall intensity remains low and it is unclear how much is related to pandemic influenza. In Central America and the Caribbean, overall respiratory disease activity remains low in most places.   In North Africa and West Asia, influenza activity is low. However, respiratory tract infections in the north western area of Pakistan and Afghanistan are reportedly increasing.  Whether this increased activity is due to circulation of influenza is not known.   In Sub-Saharan Africa, several West African countries are increasingly reporting pandemic influenza cases, though surveillance data from the area is quite limited.  Data from the rest of Africa suggests that influenza activity in most countries is low and transmission continues to be sporadic.  Some detections of seasonal influenza H1N1, H3N2, and influenza type B are still being reported.   The Global Influenza Surveillance Network (GISN) continues monitoring the global circulation of influenza viruses, including pandemic, seasonal and other influenza viruses infecting, or with the potential to infect, humans including seasonal influenza.

WHO is actively monitoring the progress of the pandemic through frequent consultations with the WHO Regional Offices and member states and through monitoring of multiple sources of information.  Situation update:   In the temperate zone of the northern hemisphere, pandemic influenza virus continues to be detected across many countries, however, overall influenza activity continues to wane in most places. The most active areas of transmission are currently in parts of south and southeast Asia and in limited areas of east and southeastern Europe.   In Southeast Asia, pandemic influenza virus continued to circulate in areas, however, the overall intensity of respiratory diseases activity remained low and unchanged, except in a few countries. In Brunei Darussalam, during February 2009, influenza activity was reported to be geographically widespread and was associated with an increasing trend and high intensity of respiratory diseases. Both Myanmar and Thailand have reported an increasing trend of respiratory diseases associated with geographically regional spread of influenza for the first half of February 2009, however, overall intensity currently remains low in both countries. In Thailand, approximately one third of provinces reported that >5% of medical visits were due to ILI during the most recent reporting week. In East Asia, virologic surveillance data suggest that pandemic influenza and seasonal influenza type B viruses continue to co-circulate. A recent increase in ILI activity in Mongolia may be due to an increase in the circulation of seasonal influenza type B viruses.  Overall influenza activity continues to decline and return to baseline levels in both Japan and the Republic of Korea (S. Korea). In Hong Kong SAR (China) and in Chinese Taipei, pandemic influenza virus continues to circulate at low levels and overall ILI activity is substantially lower than what was observed peaks of activity during the fall months. In South Asia, overall influenza activity remained low, however, pandemic influenza virus transmission persists in the western part of India.   In Europe, pandemic influenza virus transmission persists across parts of central and southeastern Europe, but overall intensity remained low, except for Greece, Bulgaria, Turkey, Slovakia, the Republic of Moldova, and parts of the Russian Federation which continued to report a moderate intensity respiratory diseases activity. Although an increasing trend of respiratory diseases continued to be reported in Georgia, Slovakia, and parts of the Russian Federation, the increased activity may be due to other circulating respiratory viruses. Among countries testing at least 20 sentinel respiratory specimens during the past reporting week, none reported that more than 20% of specimens had tested positive for influenza.   In North Africa and West Asia, pandemic influenza virus continues to circulate at low levels as rates of illness in most countries in the region continued to decline or return to baseline. In Afghanistan, an increasing trend of respiratory diseases with moderate healthcare impact was report, however, it is unknown if the recent increase is associated with circulation of influenza virus.   In Sub-Saharan Africa, limited data suggest that pandemic influenza virus transmission continued to be sporadic in most areas of the continent. Several countries in West Africa continue to report slight increases in the numbers of confirmed cases of pandemic influenza indicating that community transmission is likely beginning in the area; however, data are very limited.   In the Americas, both in the tropical and northern temperate zones, pandemic influenza virus continues to circulate at low levels but overall pandemic influenza activity continued to decline or remain low in most places. In Central America and Caribbean, pandemic influenza virus transmission persists but overall activity remains low or unchanged in most places.   Pandemic influenza (H1N1) 2009 virus continues to be the predominant influenza virus circulating worldwide. In addition to the increasing proportion of seasonal influenza type B viruses recently detected in China, low levels of seasonal H3N2 and type B viruses are circulating in parts of Africa, and Asia. In summary, pandemic influenza virus continues to circulate widely in the tropical regions and is persisting in some areas of in parts of Europe.  Respiratory disease activity is increasing in many areas of the world due to increasing transmission of influenza type B and Respiratory Syncitial Virus.  Seasonal influenza H3N2 continues to be detected in areas of Asia and east Africa.

The index case was identified in a 28 year-old man from Bandrrefan village in Bandjoun district, who presented with a clinical picture of fever, jaundice and abdominal pain at the end of December 2009.  He had no history of Yellow Fever vaccination and died on 7 January 2010, 3 days after his medical consultation. During the same period, a second case was reported in a 19 year-old male from the same village, who died on 23 January 2010, three days after he consulted the district hospital.   The two cases were identified through routine Yellow Fever surveillance.  Specimens from both cases were confirmed by laboratory tests from the Pasteur Centre of Cameroun and the Regional reference laboratory for Yellow Fever at Institut Pasteur in Dakar, Senegal.   Following identification of the two cases, an outbreak investigation was conducted in December 2009 in Fombat district, neighbouring Banjoun district.  The investigation identified a third case in a 40 year-old man who died in October 2009. The case was later laboratory confirmed with Yellow Fever.  Serum samples were taken from 77 ''contact persons'' of this case, all of which tested negative  for Yellow Fever.   Cameroon conducted a Yellow Fever mass vaccination campaign in 62 at-risk-districts covering a population of 7.4 million in May 2009.  The two districts of Banjoun and Fantun were however, not part of the campaign earlier because they did not have any cases of Yellow Fever when the vaccination campaign took place in May 2009.   The Ministry of Health plans to vaccinate 254,355 people in Banjoun and Fantun districts. The country has requested support from the International Coordinating Group on Yellow Fever Vaccine Provision (YF-ICG), which manages the global emergency stockpile of yellow fever vaccine. The ICG has approved support for the vaccination campaign, which will be financed by the GAVI Alliance through the World Health Organization.  "

WHO is actively monitoring the progress of the pandemic through frequent consultations with the WHO Regional Offices and member states and through monitoring of multiple sources of information.  Situation update:   The situation is largely unchanged since the previous update. In the temperate zone of the northern hemisphere, active but declining pandemic influenza transmission persists in limited areas of eastern and southern Europe, South Asia, and in East Asia. Several countries in West Africa  reported increases in the number of cases but there is as yet insufficient evidence to conclude that widespread community transmission is occurring. An increasing trend in respiratory diseases activity was reported in Thailand and Jamaica, however the cause of the respiratory disease is uncertain at this point.   In Southeast Asia, several countries reported an increasing trend of respiratory diseases activity but overall intensity remained low. After several months of sporadic influenza activity, Thailand reported increasing respiratory diseases activity marked by increased ILI in 24 provinces; however, the overall intensity of activity nationally remains low. In Myanmar and Indonesia, localized geographic spread of influenza activity, an increasing trend of respiratory diseases, and low overall intensity was reported. In South Asia, influenza activity persists in the northern and western states of India, however, overall influenza activity continued to decline or remained low in India, Nepal, Bangladesh, and Sri Lanka. In East Asia, transmission of pandemic influenza virus persists but has been steadily declining in most countries of region (China, Japan, and the Republic of Korea), with the exception of DPR Korea, where an increasing trend of respiratory diseases activity was reported. In West Asia, pandemic influenza virus continues to circulate in many countries, however the overall intensity of current activity remains low in the region.   In North Africa, pandemic influenza transmission persists but substantial declines in activity continue to be reported over the past month. In Sub-Saharan Africa, limited data suggest that pandemic influenza virus transmission may be sporadic in most areas of the continent. Several countries in West Africa continue to report increases in the numbers of confirmed cases of pandemic influenza, however, currently, no countries in the region are reporting an increasing trend in respiratory diseases activity.   In Europe, pandemic influenza virus continues to circulate across central and southeastern Europe, but the overall intensity of activity remained low in most places; only Greece, Bulgaria, Turkey, Slovakia, the Republic of Moldova, and the Russian Federation reported a moderate intensity of respiratory diseases activity. Several weeks of increases in ARI/ILI were reported in Slovakia and in the Russian Federation, but increased activity in these countries may be associated with other circulating respiratory viruses. Among 12 countries testing at least twenty sentinel respiratory specimes, only Hungary reported that greater than 20% specimens had tested positive for influenza.   In the Americas, both in the tropical and northern temperate zones, pandemic influenza virus continues to circulate at low levels but overall pandemic influenza activity continued to decline or remain low in most places. In Central America and Caribbean, pandemic influenza virus transmission persists but overall activity remains low or unchanged in most places. Jamaica reported an increasing trend of respiratory diseases activity but the overall intensity remains low.   Pandemic influenza (H1N1) 2009 virus continues to be the predominant influenza virus circulating worldwide. In addition to the increasing proportion of seasonal influenza type B viruses recently detected in China, low levels of seasonal H3N2 and type B viruses are circulating in parts of Africa, and Asia.

"2010","http://www.who.int/csr/don/2010_02_12/en/index.html"," Pandemic (H1N1) 2009 - update 87  Weekly update   12 February 2010 -  As of 7 February 2010, worldwide more than 212  countries and overseas territories or communities have reported laboratory confirmed cases of pandemic influenza H1N1 2009, including at least 15292 deaths.   WHO is actively monitoring the progress of the pandemic through frequent consultations with the WHO Regional Offices and member states and through monitoring of multiple sources of information.  Situation update:   In the temperate zone of the northern hemisphere, overall pandemic influenza activity continued to decline in most countries. The most active areas of transmission continue to be in later peaking areas, particularly northern Africa, South Asia, and East Asia. Of note, Senegal became the third country within the past month (and fifth overall) to confirm first cases of pandemic H1N1 2009 in West Africa. There is insufficient evidence at this point to determine if this heralds the beginning of a period of more widespread transmission in West Africa, which heretofore may have been largely spared a significant period of communitywide pandemic influenza virus transmission.   In North Africa, pandemic influenza transmission persists but substantial declines in activity have been observed over the past month across the region. In Morocco, levels of ILI have returned to near baseline, and in Egypt, the number of confirmed cases has declined considerably.   In South and Southeast Asia, pandemic influenza virus continues to circulate widely across the region, however, overall activity continues to decrease or remain low in most places. In India, influenza transmission persist, particularly in western, and to a lesser extent, in northern India, however, overall the numbers of cases have declined substantially. In Thailand, overall activity remains low and unchanged since the previous reporting period, however, focal areas of increased ILI activity were reported in central and northern Thailand.   In East Asia, pandemic influenza transmission persists across the region; however, overall activity has declined substantially in most places. In China, pandemic and seasonal influenza viruses continue to co-circulate, however, over the last several weeks, seasonal influenza type B viruses have been predominant. In Japan, influenza activity continues to decrease towards seasonal baselines, including in Okinawa which is experiencing greater levels of influenza activity than in other parts of the country. In Republic of Korea (S. Korea), levels of ILI have decreased substantially to near baseline levels.   In Europe, although pandemic influenza virus continues to circulate widely, particularly across central, southern, and eastern Europe, the overall intensity of pandemic influenza activity has declined substantially from peaks of activity seen earlier during the winter transmission period. Among 15 countries testing more than 20 sentinel respiratory samples, the proportion of samples testing positive for influenza ranged from 0-14%. Recent slight increases in rates of ARI in Slovakia, Slovenia, and the Russian federation, do not appear to be associated with detections of influenza viruses and may be due to other circulating respiratory viruses.   In Sub-Saharan Africa, limited data suggest that pandemic influenza virus transmission may be geographically localized in most countries reporting surveillance data to WHO, and the overall intensity of activity may be low.   In the Americas, both in the tropical and northern temperate zones, overall pandemic influenza activity continued to decline or remain low in most places. In Central America and Caribbean, pandemic influenza virus transmission persists but overall activity remains low or unchanged in most places. A high intensity of respiratory diseases with increasing trend was reported in Guatemala, however, the increased activity does not appear to be associated with increased detections of influenza viruses and may be due to other circulating respiratory viruses.   In temperate regions of the southern hemisphere, sporadic cases of pandemic influenza continued to be reported without evidence of sustained community transmission.  Pandemic influenza (H1N1) 2009 virus continues to be the predominant influenza virus circulating worldwide. In addition to the increasing proportion of seasonal influenza type B viruses recently detected in China, low levels of seasonal H3N2 and type B viruses are circulating in parts of Africa, East and Southeast Asia and are being detected only sporadically on other continents.

WHO is actively monitoring the progress of the pandemic through frequent consultations with the WHO Regional Offices and member states and through monitoring of multiple sources of information.  Situation update:   In the temperate zone of the northern hemisphere, overall pandemic influenza activity continues to decline or remain low in most regions since peaking during late October and November 2009. Several areas continue to have evidence of active but declining transmission, particularly in North Africa and in limited areas of Eastern Europe and East Asia.   In North Africa, pandemic influenza transmission remains active and geographically widespread but overall activity has been declining since peaking during late December 2009 and early January 2010. During January 2010, a substantial decline in the number of pandemic virus isolations and new cases was observed in Morocco and Egypt, respectively. In West Asia, pandemic influenza transmission remains geographically widespread to regional, but overall activity remained low.   In South and Southeast Asia, pandemic influenza transmission remains active but geographically localized to regional. The overall intensity of respiratory diseases activity was reported to be low to moderate in most places. In India, influenza activity continued to decline in all regions of the country, however, the most active areas of transmission currently are in the western states. An overall peak in the number of pandemic H1N1 cases was recorded in India during mid December 2009, and the majority of these cases were identified in the northern and western states of India. In Thailand, overall ILI activity remained low, however focal increase in activity were observed in several central and northern provinces.   In East Asia, pandemic influenza transmission remains active and geographically widespread across the region, however, overall activity continued to decline. In Japan, overall influenza activity continues to decline but transmission remains higher on the southern island of Okinawa than in other places. In the Republic of Korea (South Korea), rates of ILI continued to decline to near baseline after a substantial wave of activity which peaked during early to mid November 2009. In Mongolia, after a period of sustained elevated ILI activity since early November 2009, levels of ILI have recently fallen to the expected seasonal range. In northern and southern China, rates of ILI have returned to levels seen during recent seasons; however, approximately 30% of respiratory specimens tested were positive for influenza suggesting that active transmission of influenza viruses persists. Of note in China, in recent weeks the circulation of pandemic influenza H1N1 continued to decline with a concomitant increase in the circulation of seasonal influenza type B viruses (pandemic H1N1 and seasonal Type B viruses accounted for 34% and 66% of all influenza viruses detected, respectively). Active transmission of pandemic influenza virus also persists in Hong Kong SAR (China), although at significantly lower levels than an earlier peak of activity during September and October 2009.   In Europe, transmission of pandemic influenza virus remains active in a limited number of countries as overall activity remained low in most places. At least seven countries testing more than 20 sentinel respiratory samples reported that >20% of samples had tested positive for influenza (Albania, Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Georgia, Greece, Luxembourg, and Romania); however, in all seven, rates of illness remained well below earlier peaks of activity. Small increases in ILI/ARI have been reported over the past two reporting weeks in Slovakia, Belarus, and the Russian Federation. The overall rate of sentinel respiratory samples testing positive for influenza fell to 14% after reaching a peak of 45% during early November 2009.

WHO is actively monitoring the progress of the pandemic through frequent consultations with the WHO Regional Offices and member states and through monitoring of multiple sources of information.  Situation update:   Although much of the temperate northern hemisphere passed a peak of fall and wintertime pandemic influenza activity between late October and late November 2009, virus transmission remain active in several later affected areas, particularly in North Africa, limited areas of eastern and southeastern Europe, and in parts of South and East Asia.   In North Africa, limited data suggests that pandemic influenza virus transmission remains active and geographically widespread, particularly in Morocco, Algeria, Libyan Arab Jamahiriya, and in Egypt, although most countries in the region appeared to have recently passed a peak of activity during December 2009 or January 2010. In west Asia, pandemic influenza activity continues be geographically regional to widespread, however activity levels have continued to decline or remain low since December 2009.   In South Asia, pandemic influenza activity remains active but geographically variable. Recent peaks in activity were noted during late December and early January 2010 in northern India, Nepal, and Sri Lanka. Influenza activity remained stable but elevated in western India, continued to decline substantially in northern India, and remained low overall in southern and eastern India. In Bangladesh, regional spread influenza activity and a low intensity of respiratory diseases activity was reported.   In East Asia, transmission of pandemic influenza virus remains active, however, overall activity continued to decline in most countries. An increasing trend in respiratory diseases with localized spread was reported for DPR Korea. In the Republic of Korea, transmission of pandemic influenza virus remains active (>20% respiratory specimens tested positive for pandemic H1N1), however, overall activity continue to decline since peaking during November 2009. In Japan, influenza activity continues to decline, however high levels of transmission persist on the southern island of Okinawa. In northern and southern China, pandemic virus isolations have declined substantially since peaking early to mid November 2009, however, in recent weeks detections of influenza type B viruses have increased.   In southeast Asia, transmission of pandemic influenza virus persists, but current activity levels are low. In Vietnam, influenza activity has declined substantially since peaking during October and November 2009. In Thailand, focal outbreaks of influenza were reported from a few provinces in northern and central parts of the country, however, overall ILI activity remains low.   In Europe, transmission of pandemic influenza virus remains geographically regional to widespread in the central, eastern, and southeastern parts of the continent, however, overall activity continues to decline in most places. Several countries (Austria, Albania, Bulgaria, Slovakia, and the Russian Federation) reported slight increases in the levels of ARI or ILI activity, however in most, levels remain well below recent peaks in activity. The overall rate of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza (16%) continued to fall since peaking (45%) during early November 2009.   In the Americas, both in the tropical and northern temperate zones, overall pandemic influenza activity continued to decline or remain low in most places. Of note, detections of RSV have increased in a few countries in the Americas, which may partially account for elevated ILI activity in those areas, particularly among young children. In the US and Canada, pandemic influenza virus detections and the numbers of severe and fatal cases have decline substantially as rates of ILI have fallen below seasonal baselines.

In the study, half of all pregnant women had no other identifiable underlying medical condition, however, the overall prevalence of asthma, diabetes, and obesity among the group was greater than that observed in the general population of Australia. The majority of cases presented during their second trimester (30%) or third trimester (65%).

WHO is actively monitoring the progress of the pandemic through frequent consultations with the WHO Regional Offices and member states and through monitoring of multiple sources of information.  Situation update:   The overall situation in largely unchanged since last week. The most intense transmission of pandemic influenza virus continues to occur in North Africa, South Asia, and in limited areas of Eastern Europe. Overall pandemic influenza activity in the temperate northern hemisphere peaked between late October and late November 2009 and has continued to decline since.   In North Africa, limited data suggest that transmission of pandemic influenza virus remains geographically widespread and active throughout the region, but has likely recently peaked in most places. During early January 2010 only the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya reported an increasing trend in respiratory diseases activity. Egypt is now reporting a declining trend after increases in respiratory diseases activity throughout December 2009, suggesting a recent peak in activity during early January 2010. In West Asia, limited data suggests pandemic influenza virus transmission remains geographically widespread however overall activity has been declining in most places during December and January.   In South Asia, active transmission of pandemic influenza virus persists in the northern and western parts of the subcontinent, however overall activity has recently peaked. In India, influenza activity has been largely confined to the northern and western states; activity in the northern states peaked during mid December 2009 and in the western states during early January 2010. In Nepal, active transmission of virus persists, and the trend in respiratory diseases activity remains unchanged since the previous week after reporting continuous increases in activity since late October 2009.   In Europe, pandemic influenza virus transmission remains geographically widespread across parts of western, central, and southeastern Europe, however overall influenza activity continued to decline or remain low in most countries The areas of most intense transmission currently include Poland, Austria, Estonia, Romania, Hungary, and Moldova; however, in all but Romania, ILI activity has declined significantly since peaking in November. The overall rate of specimens testing positive for influenza fell to 20% in Europe after reaching a peak of 45% during early November 2009. Pandemic H1N1 2009 virus continues to be predominant circulating influenza virus in the European region with only sporadic detections of seasonal influenza viruses.   In East Asia, pandemic influenza activity remains widespread but continues to decline in most places. Mongolia reported a very high intensity of respiratory diseases during early January 2010; rates of ILI have been elevated above expected seasonal levels since late October 2009 but are well below a significant peak of activity observed during November 2009. In Japan, overall influenza activity continued to decline since peaking at the end of November 2009, however regional increases in activity were observed during late December on the southern island of Okinawa. In China, Hong Kong SAR, and Chinese Taipei pandemic influenza activity remains widespread but continues to decline or remain stable. Pandemic H1N1 continues to be the predominant circulating virus in the region but seasonal H3N2 viruses continue to circulate in very small numbers in northern China.   In the Americas, both in the tropical and northern temperate zones, overall pandemic influenza activity continued to decline or remain low in most places.   In temperate regions of the southern hemisphere, sporadic cases of pandemic influenza continued to be reported without evidence of sustained community transmission.   The Global Influenza Surveillance Network (GISN) continues monitoring the global circulation of influenza viruses, including pandemic, seasonal and other influenza viruses infecting, or with the potential to infect, humans including seasonal influenza.

WHO is actively monitoring the progress of the pandemic through frequent consultations with the WHO Regional Offices and member states and through monitoring of multiple sources of information.  Situation update:   The most intense areas of pandemic influenza virus transmission currently are in parts of North Africa, South Asia, and east and southeastern Europe.   In North Africa, limited data suggest that transmission of pandemic influenza virus remains active throughout the region, particularly in Morocco, Algeria, and Egypt. In West Asia, limit data suggest that pandemic virus continues to circulate widely with a number of countries likely having already experienced a peak in activity prior to December. Pandemic H1N1 2009 virus continues to be predominant circulating influenza virus in the northern African and western Asian regions with only sporadic detections of seasonal influenza viruses.   In South Asia, the northern and western parts of the subcontinent continued to experience active influenza transmission. In Nepal, increasing ARI activity and geographically regional to widespread influenza activity was reported during December and January. In India, overall activity may have peaked during mid to late December, however transmission has been regionally variable with a recently increasing trend in the western states, active but decreasing transmission in the northern states, and overall low activity in the eastern and southern states. In Sri Lanka, geographically widespread transmission with increasing trend of respiratory diseases was reported throughout December, however activity may have recently plateaued.   In Europe, pandemic influenza transmission remains geographically widespread throughout the continent, however, overall activity continued to decline substantially since November. A moderate intensity of respiratory diseases activity was reported in Romania, Ukraine, Turkey, and Switzerland, however, rates of ILI/ARI have been decreasing or have plateaued in all. At least four countries testing more than 20 sentinel respiratory specimens reported greater than 25% specimens were positive for influenza (Romania, Georgia, Germany, and France). The overall rate of specimens testing positive for influenza fell to 22% in Europe after reaching a peak of 45% during early November 2009.  Pandemic H1N1 2009 virus continues to be predominant circulating influenza virus in the European region with only sporadic detections of seasonal influenza viruses.   In East Asia, influenza activity remains widespread but continues to decline overall. In Japan, influenza activity remains elevated but has declined since peaking at the end of November 2009. Although influenza transmission remains active and regionally variable in China, overall activity has declined substantially since peaking during mid November 2009 in northern and southern China. In Hong Kong SAR (China), influenza activity remained stably elevated but substantially lower than a large peak of activity during late September and early October 2009. In Mongolia, rates of ILI have been elevated above seasonal baseline since late October 2009 but declined substantially since a peak of activity was observed during November 2009. In DPR Korea, geographically regional influenza activity with increasing respiratory diseases trend was reported during early January 2010. Pandemic H1N1 continues to be the predominant circulating virus in the region but seasonal H3N2 viruses continue to circulate in very small numbers in northern China.   In the Americas, both in the tropical and northern temperate zones, overall pandemic influenza activity continued to decline or remain low. In North America, peak influenza activity occurred during early, mid, and late October in Mexico, the United States, and Canada, respectively. Small areas of increased influenza activity may be occurring in central and northern Mexico.   In temperate regions of the southern hemisphere, sporadic cases of pandemic influenza continued to be reported without evidence of sustained community transmission. This suggests that the level of population immunity in areas that experienced intense, high-level transmission during a winter season is high enough to prevent sustained transmission from recurring during the summer when the virus is less transmissible.

The case occurred in the prefecture of Mandiana belonging to the Kankan region in the east of the country, near the border with Côte d'Ivoire. Côte d'Ivoire has recently conducted  an outbreak response in the border health districts of Minignan and Madinani.   The case in Guinea was a 35-year-old woman from the village of Malikila, sub-prefecture of Faralako, prefecture of Mandiana. On 23 November 2009, she presented with a clinical syndrome of fever and jaundice. The case was detected by cross-border investigation of the outbreak in Côte d'Ivoire. Following an outbreak investigation conducted by the Ministry of Health, a further six suspected cases were found in the sub-prefecture of Faralako, Mandiana-Centre and Saladou. These cases are under laboratory investigation.   The regional reference laboratory for yellow fever at Institut Pasteur in Dakar, Senegal, confirmed the yellow fever case by plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT). Other haemorrhagic fevers were excluded by specific tests.   Following the detection of this case, the MoH has decided to vaccinate the entire population of the Mandiana prefecture. A total of 12 sub-prefectures with 290 292 people are targeted for an emergency reactive mass vaccination campaign, scheduled for the third week of January 2010. Vaccines have been made available from the global emergency vaccine stockpile, managed by the International Coordinating Group for Yellow Fever Vaccine Provision (YF-ICG) with funding from the GAVI Alliance and ECHO.   Guinea is one of the high-risk endemic countries in Africa where a series of preventive mass vaccination campaigns has been implemented since 2007. Mandiana prefecture is one of the 25 prefectures in the country considered to be at highest risk of yellow fever. The prefecture was selected for preventive mass vaccination during the YF National Risk Assessment meeting in September 2008, however, the national campaign has not yet taken place due to limited vaccine supply. It is now scheduled to take place in 2010.  "

WHO is actively monitoring the progress of the pandemic through frequent consultations with the WHO Regional Offices and member states and through monitoring of multiple sources of information.  Situation update:   The most active areas of pandemic influenza transmission currently are in parts of central, eastern and southeastern Europe, North Africa, and South Asia.   In Europe, pandemic influenza transmission remains geographically widespread throughout the continent and there continues to be intense virus circulation in several countries of central, eastern, and southeastern Europe - particularly in Poland, Serbia, Ukraine, Georgia - where a high a intensity of respiratory diseases activity has been recently reported. Among countries testing more than 20 clinical specimens from sentinel sites in the past week, the greatest proportions of samples testing positive for influenza were observed in Greece (72%), Georgia (54%), Switzerland (49%), Portugal (48%), Germany (48%), Luxembourg (40%), Romania (30%), Poland (25%), and Albania (23%). In most of western and northern Europe, rates of ILI/ARI continued to decline substantially, and in many places have returned to near seasonal baselines.  Sporadic cases of seasonal H3N2 influenza have been identified in Western Europe but in very small numbers. Crude mortality rates among most European countries, measured as the cumulative number of pandemic H1N1 influenza associated deaths per million population, appear to be within the same range as rates observed elsewhere in northern and southern hemisphere, suggesting a relatively consistent global pattern of mortality.   In North Africa and West Asia, limited data suggest that influenza transmission remains active. Although west Asia may have already experienced a peak in influenza activity, parts of North Africa continues to report increasing respiratory diseases activity, particularly in Egypt. Elevated levels of ILI activity and increased influenza virus detections were observed during November and December in Algeria and Morocco, but activity has likely peaked in the later.   In South Asia, pandemic influenza transmission remains geographically widespread and active across the subcontinent - particularly in northern India, Nepal, and in Sri Lanka - where an increasing trend in respiratory diseases activity was reported. In Southeast Asia, influenza transmission remains geographically regional to widespread; however, overall influenza activity appears to be low but variable. Localized increases in ILI were reported in parts of Thailand over the past three weeks. In Vietnam, after a period of substantial influenza transmission during September through November, activity declined significantly in December. In Laos and Cambodia, overall respiratory disease activity was reported to be decreasing during most of December.   In East Asia, influenza transmission remains widespread and active but appears to be declining overall. Influenza/ILI activity continued to decline in Japan, in northern and southern China, Chinese Taipei, and Hong Kong SAR (China). Pandemic H1N1 is clearly still the predominant circulating virus but seasonal H3N2 viruses continue to circulate in very small numbers in northern China.  Slight increases in rates of ILI were again reported in Mongolia.   In central Asia, there is evidence of declining rates of ILI/ARI since respiratory disease activity recently peaked in late November and early December in Uzbekistan and Kyrgyzstan, respectively.   In the Americas, both in the tropical and northern temperate zones, overall pandemic influenza activity continued to decline or remain low. In North America, peak influenza activity occurred during early, mid, and late October in Mexico, the United States, and Canada, respectively. In all three countries, as expected, a substantially greater number of cases were recorded during the fall and winter transmission period as compared to spring and summer transmission period. In Canada, after experiencing substantial influenza activity unusually early during the fall and winter period, rates of ILI have now dropped below the historical seasonal baseline.   In temperate regions of the southern hemisphere, sporadic cases of pandemic influenza continued to be reported without evidence of sustained community transmission.  This suggests that the level of population immunity in areas that experienced intense, high-level transmission during a winter season is high enough to prevent sustained transmission from recurring during the summer when the virus is less transmissible.

The index case was a 25 year-old female who developed symptoms of fever, headache and vomiting, with no history of yellow fever vaccination. She consulted the health military post of Kédougou on 23 July 2011. The case was detected as part of a surveillance project for dengue and chikungunya conducted in the region. The WHO reference laboratory for Yellow Fever at the Institut Pasteur in Dakar confirmed the case  (IgM by ELISA test and Plaque Reduction Neutralization Test or PRNT) on 10 October 2011.   Two other cases - 29 year-old female and 3 year-old male - were reported on 10 and 11 August 2011.  All three cases have fully recovered. An outbreak investigation team assessed the situation in the Kédougou and Saraya districts from 8 to 29 August 2011, where a total of 76 people (suspected cases and their contacts, including 10 deaths) were identified. Laboratory tests conducted showed no evidence of recent yellow fever infection among the 76 people.  However, the tests (IgG) indicated that 20 of them had previously been exposed to yellow fever virus or yellow fever vaccine.   The health districts of Kédougou and Saraya benefited from a preventive mass vaccination campaign in December 2007, where the vaccination coverage was 94.9% and 94.8% respectively.   The Ministry of Health of Senegal plans to organize a vaccination campaign in mid-December 2011, targeting the non-vaccinated individuals aged nine months and above, excluding pregnant women in Kédougou, Saraya and Salémata health districts. The mass vaccination campaign aims to protect the susceptible population living in the area, which appears to have increased due to recent migration from neighboring countries. A total of 159,626 doses of vaccine from the GAVI-funded yellow fever emergency vaccine stockpile has been released by the International Coordinating Group on Yellow Fever Vaccine Provision (YF-ICG) for the campaign.

"2011","http://www.who.int/csr/don/2011_11_11/en/index.html"," Nigeria: mass lead poisoning from mining activities, Zamfara State - Update 1   11 November 2011 -  The mass lead poisoning from mining activities in Zamfara State in Nigeria, which was discovered in March 2010, continues to affect villagers in three Local Government Areas (LGAs): Anka, Bukkuyum and Maru.   While the full scale of the problem is still not fully determined, a survey carried out by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (US CDC) at the request of the Nigeria Federal Ministry of Health has revealed at least 43 villages in Zamfara State where there are confirmed cases of lead poisoning (blood lead concentration >10 μg/dL). In at least seven of these villages there are children who need chelation therapy (blood lead concentration >45 μg/dL). This is in addition to the seven villages that have now been remediated.   With the combined effects of removal from lead exposure and chelation and other supportive therapy, the mortality rate among exposed children in seven remediated villages has dropped from 43% in 2010 to 1% in 2011.  Actions taken   WHO and multiple partners have been assisting state and federal authorities to manage the situation, which cannot be resolved without sustained changes to mining practices to prevent further environmental contamination with lead. These include relocation of ore processing activities and storage of ore materials away from villages, the adoption of new processing methods that produce less dust, as well as hygiene measures such as removing contaminated clothes and washing before returning home.   WHO is continuing to advocate with the Government in Nigeria for their attention to this problem and to gain their commitment to further sustained action to prevent the serious and life-long consequences of lead poisoning in a generation of children in Zamfara.   The response to the mass lead poisoning in Zamfara State has involved multiple agencies, including WHO, United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) - Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) Joint Environment Unit, Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF), the US CDC, the Blacksmith Institute, TerraGraphics Environmental Engineering Inc, and the Artisanal Gold Council, working with authorities and leaders at community, state and federal level.   With funding of US$ 1.9 million provided by the UN Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF) to WHO and UNICEF, the following activities have been carried out:  remediation of five villages (Abare, Tungar Guru, Tungar Daji, Sunke and Duza);  social mobilization and community awareness activities directed at informing local communities about the hazards of lead and how to prevent lead exposure, including safer mining and gold extraction processes;  advocacy activities with state and federal authorities, and community leaders;  establishment of a surveillance system for the early detection of lead poisoning in Zamfara State;  provision of three hand-held x-ray fluorescence devices for the rapid measurement of lead concentrations in soil;  provision of four point-of-care analyzers and their kits for the rapid measurement of blood lead concentrations;  provision of a graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrometer, ancillary equipment and reagents, as well as technical advice, for the establishment of a reference laboratory for the measurement of lead;  training for doctors, nursing and laboratory staff at the planned lead treatment centre in Gusau on the diagnosis and management of lead poisoning;  provision of antidotal agents for the treatment of lead poisoning;  co-ordination of partners involved in the response activities.   The remediation work has been organized by the Blacksmith Institute and TerraGraphics Environmental Engineering Inc, working with the Zamfara State authorities and local contractors. Remediation has involved the identification of contaminated areas in the villages, removal of all contaminated soil, its disposal in secure landfill sites and its replacement with clean soil. In addition walls and other surfaces in family compounds have been cleaned. A total of seven villages have now been remediated, two having been completed before the CERF funding was available. TerraGraphics has provided training in assessment and remediation procedures so that they can be continued by local agencies.   MSF has continued to provide chelation therapy for lead-poisoned children in the decontaminated villages and now has over 2 000 children under five years of age on its treatment programme.  Ongoing challenges   This serious environmental emergency cannot be resolved quickly. Remediation is a challenging and time-consuming task. Children have to wait for their family compounds to be cleaned before they can start treatment, and some children will require chelation for many months. Persuading people to adopt new practices and behaviours requires continuing effort.  In addition, capacities within Nigeria for the diagnosis and management of lead poisoning need further strengthening and support. A further challenge is the purchase of sufficient chelating agents: these are expensive drugs that are not available as generics. There is therefore a need for long-term engagement on the part of leaders and authorities at community, state and federal levels in Nigeria, as well as health and environment professionals, technical partners and donors.   Of particular concern is the town of Bagega in Anka Local Government Area, which is a regional hub for ore processing and the informal gold trade. Many family compounds and communal areas in the town have soil lead concentrations above 1 000 ppm (400 ppm is the limit in the USA for areas where there are children), and it is estimated that 1 500 young children may be poisoned with lead. Before these children can be treated they must have a clean environment to live in. There is therefore an urgent need to decontaminate Bagega and the other villages and to provide chelation and other therapy.  "

Europe: As of 20 September 2011, 40 of 53 Member States in the WHO European Region have reported 26 025 confirmed measles cases for the period January – July 2011 to the WHO European Regional Office through routine surveillance and outbreak reports. The highest number of cases was reported from France with 14 025 cases for the first six months of the year. In addition, eleven of all cases in the Region were lethal (6 in France and one in each of Germany, Kyrgyzstan, Romania, the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and the United Kingdom). The predominant genotype currently circulating in the European Region is D4, the same endemic genotype from the United Kingdom in 2008. The most recent outbreak was reported from Israel in September, with 12 cases. Member States have responded to the outbreak by modifying the vaccination schedule, like France, or by offering vaccination free of charge or in schools, to increase accessibility to and availability of vaccines.   Africa: The Regional Office reports that as of September 2011 large measles outbreaks are being reported by the Democratic Republic of the Congo, with over 103 000 cases, Nigeria, with 17 428 cases, and Zambia, with 5 397 cases, and Ethiopia, with 2 902 cases. Even though deaths are not routinely reported to the Regional Office, the WHO Country Office in the Democratic Republic of the Congo reports over 1100 measles-associated deaths in the country during 2011.   Americas: The last case of endemic measles was reported from the region in 2002. In 2011 the Region has received reports of several outbreaks linked to importation of measles virus from other regions. The largest, in Quebec, Canada, involves 742 reported cases, 89 requiring hospitalization, but no measles-associated deaths. Other outbreaks have been reported from the United States (213 cases), Ecuador (41 cases), Brazil (18 cases), Columbia (7 cases), Mexico (3 cases), and Chile (6 cases). Most of these outbreaks are linked to importations from Europe, except for outbreaks in the United States and Chile linked to cases from Malaysia and the outbreak in Ecuador, linked to Kenya.   Measles is a highly infectious disease that causes complications and deaths, even in previously-healthy individuals, but is fully preventable by vaccination. Countries need to ensure that they reach 95% coverage with two doses of measles vaccine across all age groups up to 15 years of age. Otherwise the country will experience measles outbreaks with large numbers of cases, associated hospitalizations and deaths. The recent outbreaks in countries with high volumes of international travellers can lead to measles exportation to regions previously free of measles, such as the Region of the Americas or certain African countries. These exportations can lead to large outbreaks and associated deaths.   These outbreaks should remind travellers that they should ensure that they have had two doses of measles-containing vaccine before their trip.  "
"2011","http://www.who.int/csr/don/2011_09_20/en/index.html"," Confirmed international spread of wild poliovirus from Pakistan   20 September 2011 -  Wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) genetically linked to virus currently circulating in Pakistan has been isolated in China .  Pakistan is affected by nationwide transmission of WPV1, and is the location of the only wild poliovirus type 3 (WPV3) case in Asia in 2011 (a strain on the verge of elimination on the continent).  As at 13 September 2011, Pakistan had reported 84 cases, compared to 48 cases for the same period in 2010.   In 2011, supplementary immunization activities (SIAs) in Pakistan have been inadequate in quality in key high-risk areas.  In security-compromised parts of the Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA), and in particular in Khyber agency, upwards of 200,000 children have been regularly missed during SIAs conducted during the last two years.  In addition to challenges relating to reaching children in insecure areas of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and FATA, significant operational challenges continue to mar the quality of SIAs in accessible areas of Khyber and in other key transmission areas of the country, notably in the provinces of Balochistan and Sindh.  At the same time, undetected circulation cannot be ruled out due to persistent subnational surveillance gaps.  Given these factors, the widespread transmission of WPV1, documented spread internationally, and the detection of the only WPV3 in Asia in 2011, the World Health Organization (WHO) rates as 'high' the risk of further international spread of WPV from Pakistan, particularly given the expected large-scale population movements associated with Umrah and the upcoming Hajj (pilgrimage to Mecca, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia) in the coming months.   To urgently address the widespread transmission of wild poliovirus affecting the country, the Government of Pakistan has this year launched a National Polio Emergency Action Plan, under the auspices His Excellency the President.  However, the impact of the Plan is not yet being seen at the critical programme implementation level.  To rapidly build up population immunity levels to both serotypes, staggered subnational immunization days are planned for 19-21 September, to be closely followed by further activities in high-risk union councils in 54 districts of the country.  However, key to success will be to overcome remaining operational challenges in fully-accessible areas and implemented special outreach strategies with full community participation to increase access to populations in security-compromised areas.  To achieve this, full and consistent engagement and accountability at provincial, district and union-council level is urgently needed.   It is important that countries across Asia and the Eastern Mediterranean strengthen disease surveillance for acute flaccid paralysis (AFP), in order to rapidly detect any poliovirus importations and facilitate a rapid response should importation occur.  Countries should also continue to boost routine immunization coverage against all strains of polio to minimize the consequences of any introduction.   As per recommendations outlined in WHO's International travel and health , travellers to and from Pakistan should be fully protected by vaccination.  Travellers to Pakistan who have in the past received three or more doses of OPV should be offered another dose of polio vaccine before departure.  Any unimmunized individuals intending to travel to Pakistan should complete a full course of vaccination.  Travellers from Pakistan should have a full course of vaccination against polio before leaving Pakistan, with a minimum one dose of OPV before departure.  Some polio-free countries may also require travellers from Pakistan to be immunized against polio in order to obtain an entry visa.   With Hajj and Umrah season already started, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia has issued vaccination requirements for travellers (all ages) for Umrah and Hajj.  These requirements are in line with recommendations outlined in WHO's International travel and health , with the addition that travellers of all ages from polio endemic countries are required to show proof of vaccination with OPV six weeks before travel to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, and will receive a further dose of OPV upon their arrival.

"2011","http://www.who.int/csr/don/2011_08_16/en/index.html"," West Nile Virus Infection (WNV) in Europe   16 August 2011 -  Laboratory confirmed cases of West Nile Virus infection (WNV) have been reported in a number of European countries.  From the beginning of July 2011 to 11 August 2011, WNV infection has officially been reported by Albania (2 cases), Greece  (22 cases) Israel   (6 cases), Romania   (1 case) and the Russian Federation  (11 cases). The reporting reflects higher awareness among healthcare workers, enhanced laboratory capacities and favourable weather conditions with rainfall and high temperatures leading to a substantial increase in mosquitoes such as Aedes and Culex species.   The WHO Regional Office for Europe, together with key partners − such as the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), the European Network for Diagnostics of “Imported” Viral Diseases (ENIVD) and the Network for Communicable Disease Control in Southern Europe and Mediterranean Countries (EpiSouth) − have been closely monitoring the regional situation of WNV.   WHO encourages the Member States to consider implementing relevant public health measures in order to minimize the impact of a potential WNV outbreak in countries at risk.   In humans, WNV infection is often an asymptomatic or mild febrile illness. About 20% of people who become infected with WNV will develop West Nile fever. It is estimated that approximately 1 in 150 persons infected with the West Nile virus will develop a more severe form of disease (also called neuro-invasive disease). People over the age of 50 and some immunocompromised persons (for example, transplant patients) are at the highest risk for getting severely ill when infected with WNV.   Taking into account that 80 % of infections with WNV are asymptomatic and fewer than 1 % present with severe symptoms such as meningitis or encephalitis, health care workers should consider the possibility of WNV infections during the epidemic period. Due to the unavailability of vaccine against human WNV infection, clinical management plays a key role in reducing severe outcome of the disease. At country level, laboratory capacity for diagnosis should be available. Enhanced human and veterinary surveillance activities will assist public health authorities to implement control measures at source.   Efforts to prevent disease transmission should focus primarily on personal and community protection against mosquito bites. The general population, especially in the affected areas, should be informed about the typical presentation of the disease and vector control strategies, particularly in the domestic environment.

"2011","http://www.who.int/csr/don/2011_07_07/en/index.html"," Poliomyelitis in Pakistan   7 July 2011 -  Pakistan has reported wild poliovirus type 3 (WPV3) isolated from a 16-month old child with onset of paralysis on 9 June 2011, from a conflict-affected, inaccessible area of Khyber Agency, Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA). This is the only case of WPV3 detected in Asia in 2011. WPV3 transmission in Asia is on the verge of elimination, with the last case occurring more than six months ago, on 18 November 2010 (also from Khyber Agency, FATA).   Confirmation of continuation of WPV3 transmission in tribal areas of Pakistan has significant implications for the global effort to eradicate WPV3, particularly as Asia is on the verge of eliminating circulation of this strain.  The detection of WPV3 in Pakistan represents the risk that it may spread from this transmission focus to other WPV3-free areas of Asia and beyond. Globally, WPV3 transmission is at historically low levels in 2011, with other circulation of this strain restricted to parts of west Africa (17 cases in Côte d'Ivoire, Guinea, Mali and Niger), Nigeria (five cases) and Chad (three cases).  The risk of onward spread of WPV3 is deemed as high by the World Health Organization (WHO), particularly given large-scale population movements within Pakistan, between Pakistan and Afghanistan, and expected large-scale population movements associated with Umrah and the upcoming Hajj (pilgrimage to Mecca, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia) in the coming few months.   In 2011, supplementary immunization activities (SIAs) in Pakistan have been inadequate in quality in key high-risk areas and a significant proportion of children remained inaccessible in conflict affected tribal areas.  In  FATA, particularly in Khyber agency,  nearly 50% of children have been regularly missed during SIAs for the last two years.  In addition to challenges relating to reaching children in insecure areas of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and FATA, significant operational challenges continue to mar the quality of SIAs in accessible areas of Khyber and in other key transmission areas of the country, notably in the provinces of Balochistan and Sindh.  In addition to confirmation of the only WPV3 case in Asia in 2011, Pakistan is affected by country-wide geographical transmission of wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1), with 57 confirmed WPV1 cases in 2011 (as at 5 July 2011), compared with 14 WPV1 cases for the same period in 2010.   To urgently address the situation, the Government of Pakistan has this year launched a National Polio Emergency Action Plan, under the auspices of His Excellency the President.  However, the Independent Monitoring Board (IMB), set up at the request of the World Health Assembly (WHA) in 2010 to independently monitor progress towards a polio-free world, in April 2011 expressed alarm that the Plan is taking too long to implement, a conclusion echoed by the Technical Advisory Group (TAG) of the Eastern Mediterranean in June 2011.   To rapidly build up immunity to both wild poliovirus strains, a Short Interval Additional Dose Strategy (SIAD) SIA with bivalent OPV  is being conducted in Khyber Agency , the first passage on 4 July and the second on 12 July.  It is expected that, as during the most recent SIAs in mid-June, 45% (89,449) of target children in Khyber Agency (80% in Bara Tehsil, i.e. approximately 73,000) will remain inaccessible during the SIADs. National Immunization Days (NIDs) will be conducted in the country on 18-20 July, using bivalent OPV (containing type 1 & 3 serotypes).  However, key to success will be to overcome remaining operational challenges in fully-accessible areas and to implement special outreach strategies with full community participation to increase access to populations in security-compromised areas.  To minimise the risk of WPV3 re-infecting Afghanistan, Subnational Immunization Days (SNIDs) - including in border areas with Pakistan - will be conducted in the country on 10-12 July, also using bivalent OPV.   It is important that countries across Asia and the Eastern Mediterranean strengthen disease surveillance for acute flaccid paralysis (AFP), in order to rapidly detect any poliovirus importations and facilitate a rapid response should importation occur.

"2011","http://www.who.int/csr/don/2011_06_10a/en/index.html"," Poliomyelitis in Chad   10 June 2011 -  Chad is experiencing outbreaks of both  wild poliovirus  type 1 (WPV1 – 65 cases in 2011) and wild poliovirus type 3 (WPV3 - three cases).   The WPV3 outbreak has been ongoing since November 2007, and Chad is therefore considered to have re-established WPV3 transmission.  A WPV1 outbreak began in September 2010 (as a result of a newly-imported virus from northern Nigeria), and has since been intensifying.  Originally restricted to the greater N'Djamena area, WPV1 has spread in 2011 to other areas of the country, to the south (including areas bordering Central African Republic and Cameroon) and to the east (including areas bordering Sudan).   Historically, Chad has been associated with further international spread of poliovirus. Between 2004 and 2006, WPV1 spread from eastern Chad into Sudan, and subsequently to other areas of the Horn of Africa, Saudi Arabia, Yemen and Indonesia, resulting in 1,230 cases in these countries and over US$500 million in international emergency outbreak response costs.  Additionally, in 2008 and 2009, WPV3 from southern Chad spread into Cameroon and CAR.      The two outbreaks in Chad require urgent action to improve the quality of vaccination activities in order to reach a higher proportion of children with oral polio vaccine (OPV) across the entire country, and particularly in the greater N'Djamena area, in the south and in the east of the country.  Due to gaps in the quality of acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) surveillance at subnational levels, additional undetected WPV circulation cannot be ruled out.    To urgently address the situation, the Government of Chad with the technical support of  partners has just finalized a 6 month national polio emergency plan.   National Immunization Days (NIDs) using bivalent OPV have been conducted in May, with further supplementary immunization activities (SIAs) planned for June.  The Government of Chad and partners are working to ensure that technical support is allocated to priority areas; special strategies will be used to reach high-risk populations and technical capacity to fill subnational surveillance gaps will be scaled up.  As part of efforts to increase accountability for programme implementation, key indicators will be regularly monitored.  Under the National Polio Emergency Plan, heads of district administrations will be charged with overseeing implementation reviews following each SIA, and providing summaries with clear outcomes and recommendations to provincial governors, whose offices will oversee direct oversight of the operationalisation of the plan.  At the national level, monthly implementation reports will be prepared by the Ministry of Health and shared with the office of the Prime Minister.   Throughout 2010 and 2011, countries neighbouring Chad – notably Cameroon, CAR and Sudan – have all conducted multiple SIAs, to minimise the risk of re-infection.  It is important that countries across central Africa and the Horn of Africa strengthen AFP surveillance in order to rapidly detect any poliovirus importations and facilitate a timely response.  Countries should also continue to boost routine immunization coverage against polio to further strengthen population immunity and minimize the risk of any importation.  Potential for international spread:    In 2010 and 2011, outbreak response has been inadequate.  Given the uncontrolled and widespread geographic transmission of both WPV serotypes, historical spread to neighbouring countries, recent geographic expansion of WPV1 across Chad (including close to the borders with CAR and Sudan), the World Health Organization (WHO) rates as high the risk of further international spread.  With the Hajj (pilgrimage to Mecca, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia) expected to begin in early November and Ramadan in early August, it is anticipated that pilgrims are now beginning to move across west and central Africa, further increasing the risk of polio spread.  The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia last month issued polio vaccination requirements for travellers to the Hajj.  WHO Recommendation:   WHO recommends that all travellers from polio-infected areas be fully vaccinated prior to travel.  As per recommendations outlined in WHO's International travel and health (ITH), travelers to and from Chad should be fully protected by vaccination.  Travelers to Chad who have in the past received three or more doses of OPV should be offered another dose of polio vaccine before departure.  Any unimmunized individuals intending to travel to Chad require a complete course of vaccine.  Travelers from Chad should have a full course of vaccination against polio before leaving Chad, with a minimum one dose of OPV before departure.  Some polio-free countries may also require travelers from Chad to be immunized against polio in order to obtain an entry visa.

"2011","http://www.who.int/csr/don/2011_05_27/en/index.html"," Outbreak of haemolytic uraemic syndrome in Germany   27 May 2011 -  An outbreak of severe illness is causing concern in Germany, where 3 women have died and 276 cases of haemolytic uraemic syndrome (HUS) have been reported since the second week of May. HUS, which can lead to kidney failure, is a complication of an infection by particular Escherichia coli bacteria. While most E.coli bacteria are harmless, a group called enterohaemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC) can produce toxins, known as Shiga toxins or verotoxins, which damage blood cells and the kidneys. EHEC bacteria that produce these toxins are known as Shigatoxin-producing E. coli (STEC) or verocytotoxin-producing E.coli (VTEC), respectively. Many people have been hospitalized, several requiring intensive care, and new cases continue to be identified, the latest having an onset of 25 May. Some other countries have reported cases, notably Sweden, which has reported ten HUS cases, with two in intensive care. All the people affected recently visited Germany, mostly northern Germany.   The outbreak is unusual in that it has developed very rapidly, and an unusually high number of cases affect adults (86% are in people aged 18 years or older), particularly women (67%), instead of the normal high-risk groups, which are young children and the elderly. Nevertheless, cases have also been reported in school-aged children. The unusual E. coli serogroup O104 is suspected of being the pathogen likely to be associated with this outbreak. The epidemiological investigation into the source of the outbreak is under way. Although the source has not yet been determined, cucumbers are under suspicion, and the Robert Koch Institute in Germany is advising people, as a precautionary measure, to avoid eating tomatoes, cucumbers and lettuces, in addition to taking the usual hygiene measures in handling fruit and vegetables.   Germany notified WHO of the outbreak, under the International Health Regulations (IHR), as a potential public health event of international concern, and WHO is sharing information with health authorities in other countries. WHO has also offered technical assistance and stands ready to facilitate collaboration between laboratories to assist countries without the capacity to detect the unusual E. coli serogroup O104. WHO will maintain close contact with the relevant authorities.   EHEC can cause bloody diarrhoea and abdominal pain. People who develop these symptoms who are in or have recently visited Germany, particularly northern Germany, should seek medical advice urgently. The complication of HUS can cause acute kidney failure and can develop after the diarrhoea has resolved. Treatment with anti-diarrhoeal products or antibiotics is not usually recommended, as these may worsen the situation.   Regular hand washing, particularly before food preparation or consumption and after toilet contact, is highly recommended, particularly for people who care for small children or are immunocompromised, as the bacterium can be passed from person to person, as well as through food, water and direct contact with animals.   WHO does not recommend any restrictions in travel to or trade with Germany.  Useful information   Haemolytic uraemic syndrome (HUS) is a life-threatening disease characterized by acute renal failure (uraemia), haemolytic anaemia, and a low platelet count (thrombocytopenia). It predominantly but not exclusively affects children. It results from EHEC infection, and it is estimated that up to 10% of EHEC-affected patients may develop HUS, with a mortality rate ranging up to 5%. Overall, HUS is the most common cause of acute renal failure in young children. It can cause neurological complications (such as seizure, stroke and coma) in 25% of HUS patients and chronic renal sequelae, usually mild, in around 50% of survivors.   Shigatoxin-producing E. coli (STEC) or enterohaemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC) is a severe strain of E. coli bacterium that is commonly found in the gut of animals, mainly ruminants. EHEC produces toxins, known as verotoxins or Shiga-like toxins because of their similarity to the toxins produced by Shigella dysenteriae . They can cause severe foodborne disease. STEC is transmitted to humans primarily through consumption of contaminated foods, such as raw or undercooked ground meat products and raw milk, contaminated water, direct contact with animals or contact with infected people. It is destroyed by thorough cooking of foods until all parts reach a temperature of 70 °C or higher. Symptoms of disease include abdominal cramps and diarrhoea, which may be bloody. Fever and vomiting may also occur. Most patients recover within 10 days, although in a few cases (particularly in young children and the elderly), the infection may lead to a life-threatening disease, such as HUS. Preventive measures for STEC infections are similar to those recommended for other foodborne diseases, including basic good food hygiene practice, as described in the WHO Five keys to safer food .

"2011","http://www.who.int/csr/don/2011_04_21a/en/index.html"," Wild poliovirus in Côte d'Ivoire   21 April 2011 -  Côte d'Ivoire is experiencing an outbreak of wild poliovirus type 3 (WPV3) with three new cases reported with onset of paralysis on 27 January, 24 February and 27 February this year.   Genetic sequencing of the isolated viruses show that they are linked to WPV3 last detected in mid-2008 in northern Nigeria.  They are the first WPV3 recorded in Côte d'Ivoire since 2000.  In 2008-2009, Côte d'Ivoire was affected by a wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) outbreak affecting west Africa (and which was recently stopped).   There is currently a high risk of further spread of WPV3 - both within and from - Côte d'Ivoire.  It is the first time since 2000 that WPV3 has been recorded in this part of west Africa (WPV3 transmission has been limited to northern Nigeria and parts of Niger, and since 2008 also in parts of Mali and one case in Benin).  The outbreak response may be constrained by the current security situation in Côte d'Ivoire.  Due to the persistence of subnational surveillance gaps in Côte d'Ivoire and other areas of west Africa, undetected further circulation cannot be ruled out at this time.   Detection of these WPV3 cases underscores the risk suboptimal surveillance poses to the global polio eradication effort.  Globally, WPV3 transmission is at its lowest level in history, with only nine cases reported worldwide in 2011 - efforts to rapidly interrupt all remaining chains of WPV3 transmission is a key priority for the global polio eradication effort.   The overriding priority is to urgently stop the WPV3 outbreak, while maintaining high population immunity across west Africa to WPV1.  Two rounds of coordinated, multi-country supplementary immunization activities (SIAs) with bivalent oral polio vaccine (bOPV) and trivalent oral polio vaccine (tOPV) across west Africa have been/are being implemented on 25 March 2011, and again on 29 April 2011, in 15 countries across west Africa (except Côte d'Ivoire, see next paragraph).  A further outbreak response is currently planned in six countries, over and beyond these two multi-country SIAs.  Such a further response could see planned SIAs scheduled for the fourth quarter to be brought forward to earlier in the year.   In Côte d'Ivoire, the end-March SIA did not take place due to the current security and political situation.  A response round is proposed in the affected province using bOPV in late April 2011, to be followed by two National Immunization Days (NIDs), as soon as the situation permits.  Planning is underway to ensure capacity (ie technical, vaccine, operational) is in place for this emergency response.  Coordination with other United Nations (UN) organizations and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) operating in Côte d'Ivoire is ongoing, to ensure that OPV is added to any planned immunization activity, in particular for displaced populations.  Ongoing transmission will be monitored, and mop-ups implemented as epidemiology dictates.   An investigation is ongoing to more clearly identify surveillance gaps in the region, including among mobile, migrant and underserved populations.  Measures will be implemented to strengthen sub-national surveillance, to ensure that all groups and areas, particularly high-risk populations, are covered by high-quality surveillance.   As per recommendations outlined in WHO's International travel and health, travellers to and from Côte d'Ivoire, and other polio-affected countries of west Africa, should be fully protected by vaccination.  Travellers who have in the past received three or more doses of OPV should be offered another dose of polio vaccine before departure.  Any unimmunized individuals intending to travel to should have a complete course of vaccination.  Travellers from Côte d'Ivoire, and other polio-affected countries of west Africa, should have a full course of vaccination against polio before departure, with a minimum one dose of OPV before departure.

The B3 genotype of measles virus was isolated from cases in the second measles outbreak in Spain, while the D9 genotype, originating from and common in south-east Asia (e.g. Malaysia and Indonesia) was confirmed to have caused the outbreak in Istanbul, Turkey in January 2011.   In addition, this year, there have been outbreaks and an increase in the number of cases reported in Germany*, the Netherlands*, Norway*, Romania*, Russian Federation**, Switzerland* and the United Kingdom*.   Travel increases the risk for exposure to measles virus and its further spread into susceptible populations if not vaccinated. To prevent further spread, WHO encourages health authorities to advocate for immunization before travel and to provide immunizations through health systems’ immunization services according to existing national immunization schedules.

In October 2012, after the discovery of the novel coronavirus, stored samples were sent by MOH Jordan to NAMRU-3. In November 2012 NAMRU-3 provided laboratory results that confirmed two cases of infection with the novel coronavirus.   The MOH Jordan has requested WHO assistance in investigating these infections. A mission from WHO Eastern Mediterranean Regional Office (EMRO) and headquarters arrived in Amman on 28 November 2012 to assist in further epidemiological surveillance and to strengthen the sentinel surveillance systems for severe acute respiratory infections (SARIs).   In summary, to date a total of nine laboratory-confirmed cases of infection with the novel coronavirus have been reported to WHO – five cases (including 3 deaths) from Saudi Arabia, two cases from Qatar and two cases (both fatal) from Jordan.

The additional cases have been identified as part of the enhanced surveillance in Saudi Arabia (3 cases, including 1 death) and Qatar (1 case). This brings the total of laboratory confirmed cases to 6.   Investigations are ongoing in areas of epidemiology, clinical management, and virology, to look into the likely source of infection, the route of exposure, and the possibility of human-to-human transmission of the virus. Close contacts of the recently confirmed cases are being identified and followed-up.   So far, only the two most recently confirmed cases in Saudi Arabia are epidemiologically linked - they are from the same family, living in the same household. Preliminary investigations indicate that these 2 cases presented with similar symptoms of illness. One died and the other recovered.   Additionally, 2 other members of this family presented with similar symptoms of illness, where one died and the other is recovering. Laboratory results of the fatal case is pending, while the case that is recovering tested negative for the novel coronavirus.   WHO continues to work with the governments of Saudi Arabia, Qatar and other international health partners to gain a better understanding of the novel coronavirus and the disease in humans.  Further epidemiological and scientific studies are needed to better understand the virus.   WHO encourages all Member States to continue their surveillance for severe acute respiratory infections (SARI) and is currently reviewing the case definition and other guidance related to the novel coronavirus. Until more information is available, it is prudent to consider that the virus is likely more widely distributed than just the two countries which have identified cases. Member States should consider testing of patients with unexplained pneumonias for the new coronavirus even in the absence of travel or other associations with the two affected countries. In addition, any clusters of SARI or SARI in health care workers should be thoroughly investigated regardless of where in the world they occur.   Of the 6 laboratory confirmed cases reported to WHO, 4 cases (including 2 deaths) are from Saudi Arabia and 2 cases are from Qatar.  "

Of these, 20 have been fatal (7 confirmed, 13 probable).   The cases reported are from Isiro and Viadana health zones in Haut-Uélé district in Province Orientale. To date, 28 suspected cases have been reported and are being investigated.   The Ministry of Health (MoH) continues to work with partners, under the National Task Force which includes: WHO; Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF); the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC); US Agency for International Development (USAID); US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC); and the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) to identify all possible chains of transmission of the illness and ensure that appropriate measures are taken to interrupt transmission and stop the outbreak.   Response operations continue in the areas of: coordination; Infection Prevention and Control (IPC); surveillance and epidemiology; case management; public information and social mobilization; psycho social support; anthropological analysis; and logistics. Current activities include: training for health managers and heads of clinic services to strengthen surveillance; outreach to schools through principals, teachers and students; psychosocial support to affected families, particularly in Isiro and surrounding areas, where the latest cases are being detected, and to health care workers;  training of social workers who are providing support in the Ebola treatment rooms; and  interpersonal communication skills training for front-line staff.  Local community-based radio have also broadcast programmes to provide information and address the concerns of the local populations.   WHO and the Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network (GOARN) have deployed experts to support operational response. Technical support has been further strengthened with an infection prevention and control expert to assist in preventing disease transmission in health care and community settings.   With respect to this event. WHO does not recommend any travel or trade restrictions to be applied to the DRC.  General information on controlling infection of EHF in health-care settings   Human-to-human transmission of the Ebola virus is primarily associated with direct contact with blood and body fluids. Transmission to healthcare workers has been reported when appropriate infection control measures have not been observed.   Health-care workers caring for patients with suspected or confirmed Ebola virus need to apply infection control measures to avoid any exposure to the patient’s blood and body fluids and/or direct unprotected contact with the possibly contaminated environment. It is important that Standard Precautions, particularly hand hygiene, the use of gloves and other personal protective equipment, safe injections practices and other measures are applied to all patients in all health care settings.

WHO is continuing investigations into two recently confirmed infections identified as a novel coronavirus. Today WHO issued an interim case definition to help countries strengthen health protection measures against the new virus.   The case definition, based on the cases so far, includes criteria for identifying a ‘patient under investigation’, a ‘probable case’ and a ‘confirmed case’. These criteria are based on clinical, epidemiological and laboratory indicators.   Following the confirmation of the novel coronavirus, WHO - under the International Health Regulations - immediately alerted all its Member States about the virus and has been leading the coordination and providing guidance to health authorities and technical health agencies. WHO is also identifying a network of laboratories that can provide expertise on coronaviruses for countries.   On 22 September 2012, the United Kingdom (UK) informed WHO of a case of acute respiratory syndrome with travel history to Saudi Arabia and Qatar.   The case is a previously healthy, 49 year-old male Qatari national that presented with symptoms on 3 September 2012 with travel history to Saudi Arabia several days prior to onset of illness. On 7 September he was admitted to an intensive care unit in Doha, Qatar. On 11 September, he was transferred to the UK by air ambulance from Qatar. The Health Protection Agency of the UK (HPA) conducted laboratory testing and subsequently confirmed the presence of the novel coronavirus.   The HPA compared information from the clinical sample collected from the 49 year-old Qatari national with that of a virus sequenced previously by the Erasmus University Medical Centre, Netherlands. This latter isolate was obtained from lung tissue of a fatal case earlier this year in a 60 year-old Saudi national. This comparison indicated 99.5% identity, with one nucleotide mismatch over the regions compared. *   Though it is a very different virus to SARS, given the severity of the two confirmed cases so far, WHO is engaged in further characterizing the novel coronavirus. As such, international efforts are being stepped up across all WHO six regions to ensure an appropriate and effective response with a WHO specialist team in daily contact with more than a dozen international and regional technical partners.   In addition WHO is working closely with Saudi Arabia, as in previous years, to support the country’s health measures for all visitors participating in the Haji pilgrimage to Mecca next month.   * Please note the change as an earlier version stated that sequencing of the virus isolate from the 49 year old had been compared by HPA.

HPS is a rare but serious disease and is caused by a virus that individuals get through contact with the urine, droppings, or saliva of infected rodents. The deer mouse is the primary host of the virus. The disease begins with fever, chills, muscle aches, and/or gastrointestinal symptoms, but can progress rapidly to life-threatening illness. Symptoms of HPS typically occur from two to four weeks after initial exposure to the virus. However, symptoms can appear as early as one week and as late as six weeks following exposure. Person-to-person transmission of Hantavirus has not been reported in the United States of America.   There is no specific treatment, cure or vaccine for Hantavirus infection.  Early recognition and treatment of infected individuals can reduce disease progression.

The rate of new cases has accelerated rapidly since the beginning of August: since then, 5 706 cases have been recorded, and two new districts, Bonthe and Kono, have been affected by the epidemic. Ten of the country’s 13 districts are now registering cases and this spread emphasizes the need to rapidly scale up the response.   The two most heavily affected districts are Western Area and Tonkolili.   The President of Sierra Leone has declared the escalating cholera epidemic a “humanitarian crisis”. Consequently, a multi-sectoral approach to the response has been adopted involving the Ministry of Health and Sanitation (MOHS), as well as other line ministries such as finance, information and communication, and local government, together with partners and stakeholders.  A National Emergency Task force has been established with sub-committees dealing with surveillance, case management, water and sanitation, logistics and social mobilization. The WHO Country Office (WCO) in Sierra Leone is chairing a weekly meeting of partners and stakeholders to better coordinate harmonize and strategize support.   The MOHS, in partnership with Médecins sans Frontières (MSF), UNICEF, WHO, and other partners, is implementing the following prevention and control activities: epidemiological investigation, surveillance, case management at established cholera treatment centres, water and sanitation control measures, social mobilization and community education.   WHO is supporting Sierra Leone in the areas of epidemiology, social mobilization and surveillance. WHO has deployed two epidemiologists, and three cholera experts from Zimbabwe to support coordination, public information, social mobilization, case management and infection control.

Samples from a total of 31 patients were obtained and tested for a number of pathogens by Institut Pasteur du Cambodge.  Most of these samples tested positive for enterovirus 71 (EV-71) which causes HFMD.  A small proportion of samples also tested positive for other pathogens including Haemophilus Influenzae type B and Streptococcus suis . It was not possible to test all the patients as some of them died before appropriate samples could be taken.   The investigation included:  a thorough review of the hospital records of the patients from Kantha Bhopa hospital as well as from other hospitals;  laboratory tests;  active follow-up with the affected families by the local Rapid Response Teams (RRT); and  evaluation of the data from the national surveillance system.   A total of 78 cases were identified. These included the initial 62 cases reported by Kantha Bopha hospital, and cases reported from other hospitals.  Of these, the investigation focused on 61 cases that fitted a specific criteria (the case definition), and of which 54 had died.   The investigation revealed that most of the cases were under 3 years of age, from 14 different provinces, with some suffering from chronic conditions.  A significant number of cases had been treated with steroids at some point during their illness.  Steroid use has been shown to worsen the condition of patients with EV-71.   The Ministry of Health, with support from WHO and partners, which included Institut Pasteur du Cambodge and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, conducted the investigation following reports from Kantha Bopha Children’s hospital of unusual numbers of illness and deaths among children hospitalised since April 2012.   In response to this event, health centers have been instructed by the Ministry of Health to report all patients with HFMD. In addition, the Ministry of Health, assisted by WHO, has begun enhanced surveillance for neuro-respiratory syndrome, a key syndrome observed among patients with severe HFMD caused by EV-71. It is expected that the enhanced surveillance will identify occasional new cases of the severe form of the disease in the coming months.   In addition, the Ministry of Health is developing guidelines and training courses for staff to manage patients with mild and severe forms of HFMD.  A campaign to raise awareness on the prevention, identification and care of children with HFMD is underway.  "

This final review added an additional two cases between April to 5 July 2012, making the total number of children affected to be 59.  Of these, 52 have died.   The age of the cases range from three months to 11 years old, with the majority being under three years old.  The overall male: female ratio is 1.3:1.   Laboratory samples were not available for the majority of the cases as they died before appropriate samples could be taken.   Based on the latest laboratory results, a significant proportion of the samples tested positive for enterovirus 71 (EV-71), which causes hand foot and mouth disease (HFMD).  The EV-71 virus has been known to generally cause severe complications amongst some patients.   Additionally, a number of other pathogens, including dengue and streptococcus suis were identified in some of the samples.  The samples were found to be negative for H5N1 and other influenza viruses, SARS and Nipah.   Further investigations into matching the clinical, laboratory and epidemiological information are ongoing, and are likely to be concluded in a few days.   WHO and partners, which include lnstitut Pasteur du Cambodge and US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, are assisting the Ministry of Health with this event.   The Government is also reinforcing awareness of good hygiene practices to the public, which includes frequent washing of hands.  Some facts on hand foot and mouth disease:   Hand foot and mouth disease (HFMD) is a common infectious disease of infants and children.  The symptoms commonly observed include fever, painful sores in the mouth, and a rash with blisters on hands, feet and also buttocks.   HFMD is most commonly caused by coxsackievirus A16, which usually results in a mild self-limiting disease with a few complications.  HFMD is also caused by enteroviruses, including enterovirus 71 (EV71) which has been associated with serious complications in certain groups, and may cause deaths.   HFMD mainly occurs amongst children under 10 years old.  The usual period from infection to onset of symptoms is 3-7 days.   The disease usually begins with fever, poor appetite, malaise, and frequently with a sore throat.  One or two days after fever onset, painful sores develop in the mouth.  They begin as small red spots that blister and then often become ulcers.  They are usually located on the tongue, gums and inside of the cheeks.  A non-itchy skin rash develops over 1-2 days with flat or raised red spots, some with blisters.  The rash is usually located on the palms of the hands and soles of the feet, and may also appear on the buttocks and/or genitalia.  A person with HFMD may not have symptoms, or may have only the rash or only mouth ulcers. In a small number of cases, children may experience a brief febrile illness, present with mixed neurological and respiratory symptoms and succumb rapidly from the disease.   HFMD virus is contagious and infection is spread from person to person by direct contact with nose or throat discharges, saliva, fluid from blisters, or the stool of infected persons.  Infected persons are most contagious during the first week of the illness but the period of communicability can last for several weeks.  HFMD is not transmitted from pets or other animals. HFMD should not be confused with the different disease in animals called foot-and-mouth disease.   Presently, there is no specific treatment available for HFMD.  Patients should drink plenty of water or other liquids and may require treatment of the symptoms.   Health care providers are advised to treat patients according to their symptoms and to refrain from using steroids.  "

As of March 22, 2012, 623 suspected cases, including 70 deaths have been recorded from 19 of the 36 States since the beginning of the year. Laboratory analysis undertaken at the Irrua Specialist Teaching Hospital, Irrua Edo State has confirmed the presence of Lassa virus infection in 108 patients. Three doctors and four nurses were reported to be among the fatalities. This information is provisional and subject to change when laboratory results for Lassa fever in suspected cases become available.   The Federal and State governments are responding to the outbreak by enhancing the disease surveillance for early detection, reinforcing treatment of patients, and conducting awareness campaigns among the affected population.   Major challenges are the ongoing security risks in the country limiting access to some areas as well as the limited availability of resources to respond to the escalating outbreak.   WHO does not advise or recommend any restrictions on travel or trade with Nigeria. Travellers returning from affected areas who develop symptoms of fever, malaise, headache, sore throat, muscle pain, chest pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, and abdominal pain should seek medical advice.   People usually become infected with Lassa virus from exposure to infected rodents belonging to Mastomys species. Person-to-person transmission occurs through direct contact with sick patients in both community and health care settings. Those at greatest risk are persons living in rural areas where Mastomys are found. Health care workers are at risk if adequate infection control practices are not maintained.  "

These outbreaks have been detected as part of the enhanced surveillance in the African Meningitis Belt conducted in 14 countries 2 where a total of 6 685 suspected meningitis cases including 639 deaths have been reported.   The outbreaks are mainly caused by the W135 serogroup of Neisseria meningitidis (Nm) bacteria. In Chad, the predominant pathogen is Nm A, although NmW135 contributed to an outbreak in one district. Whereas NmA has always been the leading cause of epidemics in sub-Saharan Africa, outbreaks of NmW135 have already occurred in the region, since 2002.   The countries are responding to these outbreaks by enhancing surveillance, reinforcing treatment of patients and implementing mass vaccination campaigns. The International Coordinating Group (ICG) on Vaccine Provision for Epidemic Meningitis Control has approved the release of 117'500 doses of polysaccharide ACW vaccine to Côte d'Ivoire, 195'540 doses of polysaccharide ACYW vaccine to Ghana and 359'000 doses of conjugate Men A vaccine to Chad, along with injection materials and ceftriaxone (antibiotic) when necessary.

WHO continues to monitor the epidemiological situation closely, in collaboration with partners and Ministry of Health in the affected countries.   The supply of the appropriate vaccine to respond to W135 outbreaks is presently limited, and WHO and UNICEF are working closely with the vaccine manufacturers to ensure that this stock is maintained and adapted to the evolving outbreak situation.   Travelers are reminded of the importance of keeping their vaccination status up to date and to follow WHO travel advice.

"2012","http://www.who.int/csr/don/2012_01_17/en/index.html"," Silicone implants   17 January 2012 -  In March 2010, Poly Implant Prothèse (PIP) silicone implants were withdrawn from the European Union (EU) market following an observed increase in implant ruptures, and confirmation of the use of substandard silicone in the manufacture of the implants by French regulator AFSSAPS (Agence Française de Sécurité Sanitaire des Produits de Santé). Regulatory authorities in other jurisdictions were also notified, leading to product withdrawal from a number of non-EU countries. PIP implants have also been sold under the trade name of M-Implants and in April 2010 the Dutch Health Care Inspectorate prohibited all trade and usage of both products in the Netherlands.   On 23 December 2011, the French authorities published a recommendation that French residents with PIP breast implants should consider having these removed as a preventive measure. Following this, other national health authorities have issued their own recommendations that have ranged from preventive removal of PIP silicone breast implants, to close monitoring and follow up of persons with these implants.   Adverse events of approved breast implants include implant rupture and leakage. While the rupture rate of PIP prostheses was observed to be higher than expected in France, rates reported by other national authorities vary.   Testing of PIP implants carried out by AFSSAPS found that the quality of implants varied, therefore increasing the risk of rupture. AFSSAPS also found that the gel containing non-approved silicone was an irritant to tissue, and when leaking could give rise to inflammation and pain.   More information is needed about the risks associated with these implants and how they compare with other implants on the market, and on product distribution, use and surveillance.   PIP and M-Implants silicone breast prostheses have been distributed to many countries around the world. Both standard and substandard silicone has been used to produce PIP implants.   Persons with PIP or M-Implant prostheses should consult their doctor or surgeon if they suspect rupture, have pain or inflammation or any other concerns. Affected persons and physicians should take note of their national health authority recommendations and act accordingly. It is, furthermore, important to consider strengthening adverse event reporting of medical devices.

The other part of the isle is a country that is part of the Kingdom of the Netherlands (Sint Maarten). These two cases were confirmed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test performed by the French National Reference Centre for arboviruses in Marseille.   There has been an outbreak of dengue fever on St Martin / Sint Maarten since January 2013. Chikungunya disease was detected during an investigation following the notification of five cases with joint pains and fever on 18 November 2013, for whom the diagnosis of dengue was excluded. The onset of symptoms of the five cases occurred between 12 October and 15 November 2013.   As of 10 December 2013, altogether two confirmed, four probable and twenty suspected cases of chikungunya infection have been reported.   Chikungunya is a viral disease that is rarely fatal and is transmitted to humans by infected mosquitoes. Symptoms of chikungunya include high fever and headache, with significant pains in the joints (ankles, wrists), which can persist for several weeks. The symptoms appear between 4 and 7 days after the patient has been bitten by an infected mosquito. The name, chikungunya derives from a word in Makonde language roughly meaning “that which bends up”, reflecting the physique of a person suffering from the disease.   In the absence of specific treatment and an effective human vaccine, preventive measures are based on a dual strategy:  raising awareness of the risk factors for chikungunya infection as well as the protective measures individuals can take to prevent mosquito bites;  stopping the proliferation of mosquitoes by reducing their breeding grounds.   This is the first time that locally acquired transmission of chikungunya has been detected in the WHO Americas Region.   The health authorities on both the French and the Dutch side of the island are cooperating closely to respond to this outbreak, in close coordination with public health authorities in France and the Netherlands. Actions implemented by local authorities to-date include:  Epidemiological surveillance including syndromic surveillance and surveillance of severe cases.  Vector control activities have been implemented in the affected area and will rapidly be extended to the entire island, including around airports, schools, day nurseries, hospitals.  Communication and social mobilization: information is being disseminated to health professionals, to the public (on individual protection, how to eliminate the larvae breeding ground) and to the travelers by specific information in the airports.   WHO does not advise special screening at points of entry with regard to this event nor does it currently recommend the application of any travel or trade restrictions.  "

The affected localities are Lagawa, Kailak, Muglad and Abyei localities in West Kordofan and  Elreef Alshargi, Abu Gibaiha, Ghadir, Habila, Kadugli, Altadamon, Talodi and Aliri in South Kordofan.   Between 3 October and 24 November 2013, a total of 44 suspected cases of yellow fever including 14 deaths (CFR: 31.8% ) were reported from this outbreak. The field investigation carried out by the FMOH team revealed that the initial suspected cases were reported among the seasonal workers coming from the eastern states of Sudan who traveled to the state of West Kordofan for gum Arabic plantation during the month of October. Subsequently suspected cases were also reported amongst the locally residing population of both West and South Kordofan states. The blood samples collected by the field investigation team of the FMOH from the suspected cases were positive for YF by IgM ELISA Assay at the National Public Health Laboratory of the FMOH in Khartoum. The blood samples were later re-confirmed at the Institute of Pasteur of Senegal, a WHO reference laboratory for yellow fever by IgM ELISA test followed by the seroneutralizing test (PRNT) for yellow fever. The entomological survey carried out by the field investigation team also found Aedes aegepty mosquitoes in the areas, the vector that can sustain transmission of YF.   WHO is assisting the Federal Ministry of Health to strengthen surveillance and conduct active case search, particularly in the neighbouuring areas of Darfur, South Sudan as well as in those areas where the seasonal workers have started to return following completion of their work. So far no suspected cases have been reported from any of these areas. The FMOH is planning to organize a reactive mass vaccination campaign against YF in the affected areas covering the at-risk population in order to prevent the occurrence of new cases. The WHO country office is currently working with the FMOH to launch a formal request to the International Coordinating Group on Yellow Fever Vaccine Provision (YF-ICG) to provide support for a reactive mass vaccination campaign against YF.   Late last year, an outbreak of yellow fever in Darfur region of Sudan resulted in 849 suspected cases including 171 deaths (case fatality rate 20%). Around five million people were vaccinated against YF in the five states of Darfur in response to this outbreak.

Qatar investigation findings   Following the detection of two human cases infected with MERS-CoV, Qatar authorities (Public Health Department and the Department of Animal Resources) conducted a comprehensive epidemiological investigation into potential sources of exposure of human cases, with the support of an international team constituted by WHO and FAO.   Laboratory investigations at RIVM and Erasmus Medical Center have confirmed the presence of MERS-COV in 3 camels in a herd of 14 animals with which both human cases had contact. As a precautionary measure, the 14 camels on the farm have been isolated. All camels were asymptomatic or with mild symptoms when samples were taken and remained so during the following 40 days. All contacts of the two confirmed human cases, as well as the other worker employed in this barn, have been screened and laboratory tests were all negative for MERS-CoV.   These results demonstrate that camels can be infected with MERS-CoV but there is insufficient information to indicate the role camels and other animals may be playing in the possible transmission of the virus, including to and from humans. The Supreme Council of Health is working with the RIVM and the Erasmus Medical Center to test additional samples from other animal species and from the environment of the barn.

WHO and UNICEF are committed to work with all organizations and agencies providing humanitarian assistance to Syrians affected by the conflict to ensure all Syrian children are vaccinated no matter where they live.   It is anticipated that outbreak response will need to continue for at least six to eight months, depending on the area and based on evolving epidemiology.   Given the current situation in the Syrian Arab Republic, frequent population movements across the region and subnational immunity gaps in key areas, the risk of further spread of wild poliovirus across the region is considered to be high. A surveillance alert has been issued for the region to actively search for additional potential cases in addition to implementing the recommended supplementary immunization activities with oral polio vaccine.

Of these, three are from the state of Veracruz and one from the state of Hidalgo.   Since the beginning of this outbreak in September 2013 to date, a total of 184 confirmed cases, including one death, of cholera due to Vibrio cholerae O1 Ogawa has been reported in the country. Of these, 160 cases from the state of Hidalgo, 11 from the state of Veracruz, nine from the state of Mexico, two are from the Federal District, and two from the state of San Luis Potosi.   The health authorities of Mexico continue to strengthen surveillance and to ensure the availability and quality of care in medical units.   Measures are being implemented to ensure access to drinking water and basic sanitation at the community level. Awareness campaigns, particularly around safe water and food consumption are being carried out in Spanish and indigenous languages. Health professionals at different levels of the health care system are being trained in prevention and treatment of the disease.   An antimicrobial susceptibility test for Vibrio cholerae O1 Ogawa was conducted by the Institute of Epidemiological Diagnostics and Reference (InDRE) which demonstrated that the bacterium was susceptible to doxycycline and chloramphenicol, with reduced susceptibility to ciprofloxacin and resistance to trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole.   This is the first local transmission of cholera recorded since 2001 in Mexico. The genetic profile of the bacterium obtained from patients in Mexico presents high similarity (95%) with the strain that is currently circulating in three Caribbean countries (Haiti, Dominican Republic and Cuba), and is different from the strain that had been circulating in Mexico during 1991-2001.   WHO does not recommend that any travel or trade restrictions be applied to Mexico with respect to this event.  "
"2013","http://www.who.int/csr/don/2013_11_21/en/index.html"," Wild poliovirus in Cameroon    Disease outbreak news      21 November 2013 -  Wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) has been confirmed in Cameroon, the first wild poliovirus in the country since 2009.  Wild poliovirus was isolated from two acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) cases from West Region.  The patients developed paralysis on 1 October and 19 October 2013.  Genetic sequencing indicates that these viruses are linked to wild poliovirus last detected in Chad in 2011.   An emergency outbreak response plan is being finalized, including at least three national immunization days (NIDs), the first of which was conducted on 25-27 October 2013.  Subnational immunization days (SNIDs) will be implemented in December 2013, followed by two subsequent national immunization days in January and February 2014.  Routine immunization rates are reported to be approximately 85.3 percent for oral polio vaccine (OPV3).   A response in neighbouring countries is also being planned, notably in Chad and Central African Republic.   Considering that this strain was last detected in the region in 2011, plans are also being developed to strengthen surveillance activities starting with a detailed analysis of sub-national surveillance sensitivity across the region to more clearly ascertain any gaps.   In 2013, Cameroon also reported four cases due to circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) in the Far North region.  The patients developed paralysis between 9 May and 12 August 2013.  The viruses are linked to circulation in Chad, which was also detected in Nigeria and Niger.  In response, several large-scale supplementary immunization activities (SIAs) had been conducted during the months of August and September, followed by the full national immunization days in October 2013.   This event confirms the risk of ongoing international spread of a pathogen (wild poliovirus) slated for eradication.  Given the history of international spread of polio from northern Nigeria across West and Central Africa and subnational surveillance gaps, WHO assesses the risk of further international spread across the region as high.   It is important that all countries, in particular those with frequent travel and contacts with polio-affected countries and areas, strengthen surveillance for acute flaccid paralysis cases in order to rapidly detect any new virus importations and to facilitate a rapid response. Countries, territories and areas should also maintain uniformly high routine immunization coverage at the district level to minimize the consequences of any new virus introduction.

Genetic sequencing indicates that the isolated viruses are most closely linked to virus detected in environmental samples in Egypt in December 2012 (which in turn had been linked to wild poliovirus circulating in Pakistan).  Closely related wild poliovirus strains have also been detected in environmental samples in Israel, West Bank and Gaza Strip since February 2013. Wild poliovirus had not been detected in the Syrian Arab Republic since 1999.   A comprehensive outbreak response continues to be implemented across the region.  On 24 October 2013, an already-planned large-scale supplementary immunization activity was launched in the Syrian Arab Republic to vaccinate 1.6 million children against polio, measles, mumps and rubella, in both government-controlled and contested areas.  Implementation of a supplementary immunization campaign in Deir Al Zour province commenced promptly when the first ‘hot’ acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) cases were reported.  Larger-scale outbreak response across the Syrian Arab Republic and neighbouring countries will continue for at least 6-8 months depending on the area and based on the evolving situation.   Given the current situation in the Syrian Arab Republic, frequent population movements across the region and the immunization level in key areas, the risk of further international spread of wild poliovirus type 1 across the region is considered to be high. A surveillance alert has been issued for the region to actively search for additional potential cases.

"2013","http://www.who.int/csr/don/2013_10_29/en/index.html"," Polio in the Syrian Arab Republic    Disease outbreak news      29 October 2013 -  Following reports of a cluster of 22 acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) cases on 17 October 2013 in the Syrian Arab Republic, wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) has been isolated from ten of the cases under investigation.  Final genetic sequencing results are pending to determine the origin of the isolated viruses.  Wild poliovirus had not been detected in the Syrian Arab Republic since 1999.   Most of the cases are very young (below two years of age), and were un- or under-immunized.  Estimated immunization rates in the Syrian Arab Republic declined from 91 percent in 2010 to 68 percent in 2012.   Even before this laboratory confirmation, health authorities in the Syrian Arab Republic and neighbouring countries had begun the planning and implementation of a comprehensive outbreak response.  On 24 October 2013, an already-planned large-scale supplementary immunization activity (SIA) was launched in the Syrian Arab Republic to vaccinate 1.6 million children against polio, measles, mumps and rubella, in both government-controlled and contested areas.   Implementation of an SIA in Deir Al Zour province commenced promptly when the first ‘hot cases’ were reported.  Larger-scale outbreak response across the Syrian Arab Republic and neighbouring countries is anticipated to begin in early November 2013, to last for at least six to eight months depending on the area and based on evolving epidemiology.   Given the current situation in the Syrian Arab Republic, frequent population movements across the region and subnational immunity gaps in key areas, the risk of further international spread of wild poliovirus type 1  across the region is considered to be high.  A surveillance alert has been issued for the region to actively search for additional potential cases.   WHO’s International Travel and Health recommends that all travellers to and from polio-infected areas be fully vaccinated against polio.  "

The five cases occurred in the geographic zone of la Huasteca, an area where urbanization, availability of drinking water and basic sanitation services are limited.   From 9 September to date, a total of 176 confirmed cases, including one death, of infection with Vibrio cholerae O1 Ogawa toxigenic has been reported in the country.  Of these, two are from the Federal District, 157 cases from the state of Hidalgo, nine from the state of Mexico, two from the state of San Luis Potosi and six from the state of Veracruz. Eighty-nine of the total confirmed cases are women and 87 are men.  Fifty-seven cases have been hospitalized.   An antimicrobial susceptibility test for Vibrio cholerae O1 Ogawa toxigenic was conducted by the Institute of Epidemiological Diagnostics and Reference (InDRE) which demonstrated that the bacterium was susceptible to the medicines doxycycline and chloramphenicol, with reduced susceptibility to ciprofloxacin and resistance to trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole.   The health authorities of Mexico continue to strengthen outbreak investigation and surveillance at the national level and continue to ensure the availability and quality of care in medical units. Health professionals at different levels of the health care system are being trained in prevention, treatment and control of the disease. Measures are being implemented to ensure access to drinking water and basic sanitation at the community level. Awareness campaigns, particularly around safe water and food consumption are being carried out in Spanish and indigenous languages.   This is the first local transmission of cholera recorded since the 1991-2001 cholera epidemic in Mexico. The genetic profile of the bacterium obtained from patients in Mexico presents high similarity (95%) with the strain that is currently circulating in three Caribbean countries (Haiti, Dominican Republic and Cuba), and is different from the strain that had been circulating in Mexico during 1991-2001 epidemic.

The Horn of Africa is currently experiencing an outbreak of WPV1, with 174 cases in Somalia, 14 cases in Kenya and three cases in Ethiopia.  Because of the routes of poliovirus spread in previous Horn of Africa outbreaks, South Sudan had been considered at high risk of re-infection.  In 2013, South Sudan conducted two National Immunization Days (NIDs) in March 2013 and April 2013, with additional NIDs planned for November 2013 and December 2013.  Subnational Immunization Days (SNIDs) were conducted in August 2013.   Contingency plans for an emergency  outbreak response are currently being finalized, including an immediate supplementary immunization activity (SIA) in and around the infected areas.   An international team of experts is being deployed to South Sudan, to assist the local authorities in further case investigations, planning for appropriate outbreak response, and further intensifying active searches for additional potential cases.   Immunization rates in neighbouring Sudan and Uganda are also being assessed to determine overall population immunity levels.  As needed, additional SIAs will be conducted to help fill any identified immunity gaps.  Uganda conducted SNIDs in July 2013 and September 2013, with further SNIDs planned for October 2013 and NIDs in December 2013.  Sudan plans to conduct NIDs in November 2013 and December 2013.

The risk assessment reflects evidence of increasing geographic extent of WPV1 circulation in Israel over a prolonged period of time.  Recently, WPV1 has also been isolated from sewage samples collected by the Palestinian Authority , both in West Bank and the Gaza Strip.  No cases of paralytic polio have been reported by Israel or the Palestinian Authority.   Health authorities of Israel and the Palestinian Authority have taken steps to respond to the threat posed by WPV1 circulation by strengthening surveillance for acute flaccid paralysis and increasing the frequency of environmental sample collection.  A supplementary immunization activity with bivalent oral polio vaccine (bOPV) is being conducted in Israel since early August, targeting children up to nine years of age to rapidly interrupt WPV1 circulation.  As of now, 60 percent of the 1.38 million children targeted in Israel have been vaccinated.  Health authorities of the Palestinian Authority are preparing to conduct two supplementary immunization activities with trivalent OPV in the Gaza Strip and in West Bank.   It is important that all polio-free countries, in particular those with frequent travel and contacts with poliovirus-affected countries and areas, strengthen surveillance for cases of acute flaccid paralysis in order to rapidly detect any new virus importations and to facilitate a rapid response.

This risk assessment reflects evidence of increasing geographic extent of circulation over a prolonged period of time.   WPV1 has been detected in 67 sewage samples from 24 sampling sites in Israel, collected from 3 February 2013 to 4 August 2013. Initially restricted to southern Israel, WPV1 has now also been detected in the central district as well.  WPV1 has also been isolated in stool samples from 27 healthy children (all under the age of nine years) and one adult, who had been fully immunized for their age as part of ongoing stool sample survey activities. No case of paralytic polio has been reported. In addition to routine acute flaccid paralysis, public health authorities have expanded the surveillance to all age groups and have increased enterovirus surveillance and are screening aseptic meningitis cases for polio.   A supplementary immunization activity (SIA) with bivalent oral polio vaccine (OPV) started in parts of southern Israel during the week of 5 August 2013, and a nationwide campaign is planned for 18 August 2013 for children up to the age of nine years. The objective of these SIAs with OPV is to boost mucosal immunity levels in cohorts of children naïve to OPV to rapidly interrupt virus circulation.   It is important that all countries, in particular those with frequent travel and contacts with polio affected countries, strengthen surveillance for cases of acute flaccid paralysis (AFP), in order to rapidly detect any new poliovirus importations and facilitate a rapid response. Countries should also analyze routine immunization coverage data to identify any subnational gaps in population immunity to guide catch-up immunization activities and thereby minimize the consequences of any new virus introduction. Priority should be given to areas at high-risk of importations and where OPV3/DPT3 vaccine coverage is less than 80 percent.   WHO’s International Travel and Health recommends that all travellers to and from poliovirus-affected areas be fully vaccinated against polio. Three countries remain endemic for indigenous transmission of WPV: Nigeria, Pakistan and Afghanistan. Additionally, in 2013, the Horn of Africa has been affected by an outbreak of WPV1.  "

"2013","http://www.who.int/csr/don/2013_07_15/en/index.html"," Poliovirus detected from environmental samples in Israel - update   15 July 2013 -  Wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) has been isolated in 30 sewage samples from 10 sampling sites in Israel.  The samples were collected from 3 February 2013 to 30 June 2013.  Most positive WPV1 samples were detected from southern Israel.  All viruses have been detected in sewage only; no cases of paralytic polio have been reported.   Detection of viruses across the country indicates increased geographic extent of circulation for a prolonged period of time.  WHO assesses the risk of further international spread of WPV from Israel as moderate to high.   Health authorities in Israel are continuing to conduct a full epidemiological and public health investigation to actively search for potential cases of paralytic polio and any un-immunized persons.  Routine immunization coverage is estimated at 94 percent or above over last eight years.  The frequency of environmental surveillance sampling has been increased.  Environmental surveillance is frequently used by countries around the world, including in Israel, to support the detection of diseases of public health importance.  Similar activities are being implemented by health authorities in Gaza and West Bank and no WPV has been detected to date from these areas.   The Government of Israel is planning supplementary immunization activities (SIA) with oral polio vaccine (OPV).  The objectives of the SIAs with OPV are to boost mucosal immunity levels to rapidly interrupt virus circulation.  These SIAs follow efforts initiated beginning of June 2013 to catch-up with any un or under immunized children using inactivated polio vaccine (IPV).   It is important that all countries, in particular those with frequent travel and contacts with polio affected countries, strengthen surveillance for cases of acute flaccid paralysis (AFP), in order to rapidly detect any new poliovirus importations and facilitate a rapid response. Countries should also analyze routine immunization coverage data to identify any subnational gaps in population immunity to guide catch-up immunization activities and thereby minimize the consequences of any new virus introduction. Priority should be given to areas at high-risk of importations and where OPV3 or IPV3/DPT3 vaccine coverage is less than 80 percent.   WHO’s International Travel and Health recommends that all travellers to and from polio affected areas be fully vaccinated against polio. Three countries remain endemic for indigenous transmission of WPV: Nigeria, Pakistan and Afghanistan. Additionally, in 2013, the Horn of Africa is affected by an outbreak of WPV.  "

"2013","http://www.who.int/csr/don/2013_06_06_menin/en/index.html"," Meningococcal disease: 2013 epidemic season in the African Meningitis Belt   6 June 2013 -  From 1 January to 12 May 2013 (epidemiologic week 19), 9 249 suspected cases of meningitis, including 857 deaths,  with a case fatality ratio of 9.3 percent, have been reported from 18 of the 19 African countries under enhanced  surveillance 1 for meningitis. The number of cases reported so far are the lowest recorded during the epidemic season in the last ten years 2 .   Outbreaks of the meningococcal disease have been confirmed in Guinea and South Sudan, where 404 suspected cases 3 (38 deaths) and 196 suspected cases (13 deaths) have respectively been notified.   In Guinea a small outbreak at the sub-district level was reported in Siguiri district, predominantly due to Neisseria meningitidis serogroup W135 (Nm W135). Upon request from the Ministry of Health of Guinea, the International Coordinating Group (ICG) 4 on Vaccine Provision for Epidemic Meningitis Control released 63 075 doses of ACW polysaccharide vaccines. A reactive vaccination campaign targeting the affected population was conducted by the Ministry of Health from 2-7 May 2013.   In South Sudan an outbreak of Neisseria meningitidis serogroup A (Nm A) was confirmed in Malakal county, in the Upper Nile state.  The ICG  released 198 770 doses of Meningococcal A conjugate vaccine to implement a reactive vaccination campaign from 15-24 May 2013, which was led by the Ministry of Health of South Sudan with the support of WHO and partners.   Additionally, outbreaks of  meningitis  were reported in Benin (1 district),  Burkina Faso (1 district), and Nigeria (3 districts). These outbreaks were of short duration and the predominance of the Nm bacteria was not confirmed. The ministries of health of affected areas implemented a series of preventive and control measures which include reinforcement of surveillance, case management and sensitization of the population.   The decrease in the number of cases of meningitis reported during the period under review is thought to be due to the progressive introduction of the newly developed Meningococcal A conjugate vaccine in countries of the African Meningitis Belt since 2010 5 . The introduction of this first meningococcal vaccine available for preventive purposes in Africa has enabled the immunization of over 100 million people from 10 countries 6 in the Meningitis Belt in the past three years (2010-2012). The reduced case load and epidemic activity observed this year, adds to the evidence on the impact of the introduction of this vaccine, which is expected to eliminate epidemics of Nm A, which is the predominant cause of the disease in Africa.   Given that large-scale epidemics in the African Meningitis Belt appear to occur in waves of 4 to 10 years, close surveillance for meningitis remains essential.   Meningitis outbreaks are detected as part of the enhanced meningitis surveillance system introduced in 2002, whereby participating countries collect and send weekly, district level data to the WHO African Regional Office Inter-Country support team of Ouagadougou, which compiles and disseminates this data through a weekly regional bulletin. This allows for timely detection of outbreaks at district level, as well as monitoring of the situation at a regional level, enabling the identification of cross border, multi-country epidemics and a coordinated response.   WHO continues to monitor the epidemiological situation closely, in collaboration with partners and ministries of health in the affected countries.   1 The countries with enhanced surveillance for meningococcal disease include Benin, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, the Central African Republic, Chad, Côte d'Ivoire, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ethiopia, the Gambia, Ghana, Guinea, Mali, Mauritania, Niger, Nigeria, Senegal, South Sudan, Sudan and Togo. For 2013, no reports were available for Ethiopia. For Central African Republic reports were available up to epidemiologic weeks 10 and for Ghana and Guinea up to epidemiologic week 18.   2 WHO Weekly Epidemiological Record, 22 March 2013   3 Data up to epidemiologic week 18.   4 The ICG is a partnership between WHO, International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC), United Nations Children Fund (UNICEF), and Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF ) which manages an emergency vaccine stockpile, established with the support of the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization (GAVI).   5 The new vaccine MenAfriVac® is manufactured by Serum Institute of India Ltd. and was developed for the meningitis belt through the Meningitis Vaccine Project, a partnership between WHO and PATH, funded by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.   6 Burkina Faso (2010), Mali (2010–2011), Niger (2010–2011), Cameroon (2011–2012), Chad (2011–2012), Nigeria (2011- ), Ghana (2012), Benin (2012), Senegal (2012), Sudan (2012– ).

"2013","http://www.who.int/csr/don/2013_06_03/en/index.html"," Poliovirus detected from environmental samples in Israel   3 June 2013 -  In Israel, wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) was isolated from sewage samples collected on 9 April 2013 in Rahat, southern Israel.  The virus has been detected in sewage only; no case of paralytic polio has been reported.  Genetic sequencing and epidemiological investigations are ongoing to determine its origin.  Preliminary analyses indicate the strain is not related to the virus currently affecting the Horn of Africa.  The virus isolate was detected through routine environmental surveillance in Israel that involves regular testing of sewage water.  Israel has been free of indigenous WPV transmission since 1988.  In the past, wild poliovirus has been detected in environmental samples collected in this region between 1991 and 2002 without occurrence of cases of paralytic polio in the area.   Following detection of the wild poliovirus, health authorities in Israel are conducting a full epidemiological and public health investigation, actively searching for potential cases of paralytic polio as well as for any un-immunized persons.  Routine immunization levels are estimated at 94 percent.  Outcomes of the investigation will determine the need for any additional catch-up immunization activities, as necessary.  Similar activities are being implemented by health authorities in Gaza and the West Bank.  Specimens collected through environmental surveillance since 2002 in both Gaza and the West Bank have consistently tested negative for the presence of WPV.   Given that there are high levels of population immunity levels in the area, and the investigations and response being implemented, the World Health Organization (WHO) assesses the risk of further international spread of this virus strain from Israel as low to moderate.   It is important that all countries, in particular those with frequent travel and contacts with polio affected countries, strengthen surveillance for cases of acute flaccid paralysis (AFP), in order to rapidly detect any new poliovirus importations and facilitate a rapid response. Countries should also analyze routine immunization coverage data to identify any subnational gaps in population immunity to guide catch-up immunization activities and thereby minimize the consequences of any new virus introduction. Priority should be given to areas at high-risk of importations and where OPV3/DPT3 vaccine coverage is less than 80 percent.   WHO’s International Travel and Health recommends that all travellers to and from polio affected areas be fully vaccinated against polio.  Three countries remain endemic for indigenous transmission of WPV:  Nigeria, Pakistan and Afghanistan.  Additionally, in 2013, the Horn of Africa is affected by an outbreak of WPV, with six cases confirmed in Kenya and Somalia.  "

The two laboratory confirmed cases are a 34-year-old man and a 35-year-old woman.  They are siblings.  Both of them had mild respiratory illness and did not require hospitalization.  Retrospective investigation into the cases revealed that the probable case, their father, 66 year old, became ill three days after returning from a visit to Qatar and Saudi Arabia on 3 May 2013.  He was admitted to a hospital after developing acute respiratory disease.  His condition deteriorated and he died on 10 May 2013. He had an underlying health condition.  Initial laboratory tests conducted on the probable case tested negative for nCoV.   Further investigation into this outbreak is ongoing and close contacts of the family are being monitored for any unusual signs of illness.  These are the first confirmed cases of infection with nCoV in Tunisia.   In Saudi Arabia, a patient earlier reported as part of the ongoing investigation into an outbreak that began in a health care facility since the beginning of April 2013, has died.  To date, a total of 22 patients including 10 deaths have been reported from this outbreak in the Eastern part of Saudi Arabia. The government is conducting an ongoing investigation into the outbreak.   Globally, from September 2012 to date, WHO has been informed of a total of 43 laboratory-confirmed cases of infection with nCoV, including 21 deaths. Several countries in the Middle East have been affected.  They are Jordan, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates (UAE). Cases have also been reported by four additional countries: France, Germany, Tunisia and the United Kingdom. All of the  cases have had a direct or indirect connection to the Middle East, including two cases with recent travel history from the UAE. In France and the United Kingdom, there has been limited local transmission among close contacts who had not been to the Middle East but had been in contact with a traveler who recently returned from the Middle East.   Based on the current situation and available information, WHO encourages all Member States to continue their surveillance for severe acute respiratory infections (SARI) and to carefully review any unusual patterns.   Health care providers are advised to maintain vigilance.  Recent travelers returning from the Middle East who develop SARI should be tested for nCoV as advised in the current surveillance recommendations.  Specimens from patients’ lower respiratory tracts should be obtained for diagnosis where possible. Clinicians are reminded that nCoV infection should be considered even with atypical signs and symptoms, such as diarrhoea, particularly in patients who are immunocompromised.   Health care facilities are reminded of the importance of systematic implementation of infection prevention and control (IPC). Health care facilities that provide care for patients with suspected nCoV infection should take appropriate measures to decrease the risk of transmission of the virus to other patients, health care workers and visitors.   All Member States are reminded to promptly assess and notify WHO of any new case of infection with nCoV, along with information about potential exposures that may have resulted in infection and a description of the clinical course.

A four-month-old girl near Dadaab, Kenya, developed symptoms of acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) on 30 April 2013.  Two healthy contacts of the child tested positive for WPV1. They are the first laboratory confirmed cases in Kenya since July 2011.  Investigation into this outbreak is ongoing.  In addition, a case of WPV1 in Banadir, Somalia was confirmed on 9 May 2013.   In response to the outbreak, the first vaccination campaign, reaching 440 000 children began on 14 May 2013 in Somalia and a second round of vaccination is planned for 26 May 2013 in synchronization with the affected parts of Kenya.   The risk to neighbouring countries is deemed as very high, due to large-scale population movements across the Horn of Africa and persistent immunity gaps in some areas.  Dadaab hosts a major refugee camp, housing nearly 500 000 persons from across the Horn of Africa.   An alert for enhanced surveillance for polio has been issued to all countries across the Horn of Africa, highlighting the need to conduct active searches for any suspected cases.  All countries are urged to rapidly identify sub-national surveillance gaps and to take measures to fill the gaps.   In 2005, polio spread east across the African continent, and into Yemen and the Horn of Africa, resulting in over 700 cases. Since then, international outbreak responses have been adopted and new monovalent and bivalent oral polio vaccines have been developed, which can significantly reduce the severity and length of polio outbreaks.   Some areas of Somalia (south-central) are also affected by an outbreak due to circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2), which has resulted in 18 cases in Somalia since 2009.  In 2012, this strain spread to Dadaab, causing three cases.   WHO’s International Travel and Health recommends that all travellers to and from polio-infected areas be fully vaccinated against polio.

This is the first WPV to be reported from Somalia since 25 March 2007. The virus was isolated from specimens collected on 21 April 2013 from a 32-month-old girl, who became ill due to acute flaccid paralysis on 18 April 2013, and from specimens collected from 3 of her close contacts.   An investigation team is on site; genetic sequencing of the virus is on-going to determine its origin. The preliminary results of these investigations will be reported as soon as possible.   Given that substantial areas of central and southern Somalia have not conducted vaccination activities since 2009, the confirmation of WPV circulation would constitute a serious national and international risk to public health.   A surveillance alert, highlighting the need for urgent active searches for additional cases of acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) and suspect polio in all health facilities, has been issued for all of Somalia and bordering areas of northern Kenya and eastern Ethiopia. All countries in the WHO Regions of Africa and the Eastern Mediterranean are advised to heighten their surveillance for poliovirus.   An immediate vaccination response with oral polio vaccine (OPV) is being planned to begin on May 14-16 to reach more than 350,000 children under the age of five in all the 16 districts of Banadir region, with a series of subsequent activities, including nationwide OPV campaigns, under discussion.

WHO is currently publishing information on laboratory confirmed cases received through the official notification from the Chinese National International Health Regulations (IHR) Focal Point once a day. This formal notification and publication follows verification of the information, and may therefore come after, or not include, some cases reported through public media and other sources.   2. To date, there is limited information to determine whether the reported number of cases represents some or all of the cases actually occurring. As some relatively mild cases of illness have now been reported, it is possible that there are other such cases that have not been identified and reported.   3. If the current pattern of sporadic infections continues, WHO will cease frequent reporting of case numbers, and focus its Disease Outbreak News on new developments or changes in the pattern or presentation of infections.

Based on the current situation and available information, WHO encourages all Member States to continue their surveillance for severe acute respiratory infections (SARI) and to carefully review any unusual patterns. Testing for the new coronavirus should be considered in patients with unexplained pneumonias, or in patients with unexplained severe, progressive or complicated respiratory illness not responding to treatment.   Any clusters of SARI or SARI in healthcare workers should be thoroughly investigated, regardless of where in the world they occur.   New cases and clusters of the NCoV should be reported promptly both to national health authorities and to WHO.   WHO does not advise special screening at points of entry with regard to this event nor does it recommend that any travel or trade restrictions be applied.   WHO continues to closely monitor the situation.  "

The two cases from Goz Beida and Guereda districts, were laboratory confirmation by a WHO regional reference laboratory for yellow fever, Institut Pasteur in Dakar, Senegal.  They were identified through the national surveillance programme for yellow fever, following intensive surveillance which was triggered in response to the outbreak of yellow fever in neighbouring Sudan’s Darfur region.  The intensive surveillance in Chad also reported 139 suspected cases and 9 deaths.   The vaccination campaign will be conducted in 3 districts bordering Darfur, Sudan, namely Goz Beida, Guereda and Adré, targeting over a million people, including inhabitants of refugee camps in the area.  The campaign is supported by the Chad’s Ministry of Health, the International Coordinating Group on Yellow Fever Vaccine Provision (YF-ICG1 1 ), and GAVI Alliance.   1 The YF-ICG is a partnership that manages the stockpile of yellow fever vaccines for emergency response on the basis of a rotation fund. It is represented by United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) and the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) and WHO, which also serves as the Secretariat. The stockpile is supported by GAVI Alliance.  "

The patient is a UK resident and a relative  of the case  announced on 11 February 2013.   The latest confirmed case does not have any recent travel history outside the UK and is currently hospitalized in an intensive care unit. It is understood that this patient  has pre-existing medical conditions that may have increased susceptibility to respiratory infections.   Confirmed NCoV in a person without recent travel history indicates that infection was  acquired in the UK.  To date, evidence of person-to-person transmission has been limited. Although this case is suggestive of person-to-person transmission, on the basis of current evidence, the risk of sustained person-to-person transmission appears to be very low.   The Health Protection Agency (HPA) is following up on all close contacts (family and healthcare workers) who may have been exposed to either of these two new confirmed cases.   As of 13 February 2013, a total of 11 confirmed cases of human infection with NCoV have  been notified to WHO, with no change in the number of fatalities i.e., five deaths since April 2012.   Based on the current situation and available information, WHO encourages all Member States to continue their surveillance for severe acute respiratory infections (SARI) and to carefully review any unusual patterns. Testing for the new coronavirus should be considered in  patients with unexplained pneumonias, or in patients with unexplained severe, progressive or complicated respiratory illness not responding to treatment.

A WPV1 case had been detected from Tahoua region, with onset of paralysis on 15 November 2012 (the first case in the country since December 2011). Genetic sequencing confirmed that the virus was a new importation into Niger, most closely related to virus circulating in Kaduna state, Nigeria.   The Government of Niger is continuing to implement a comprehensive response in line with international outbreak response guidelines issued by the World Health Assembly (WHA) in Resolution WHA59.1.  Following an initial supplementary immunization activity (SIA) on 15 January 2013 to reach approximately two million children with bivalent oral polio vaccine (OPV), nationwide SIAs were conducted from 2-5 February 2013, targeting more than five million children with trivalent OPV.  A second nationwide SIA is planned for 2-5 March with bivalent OPV.  Previously, nationwide SIAs had been conducted on 23 November 2012 with bivalent OPV.  A joint national and international team of epidemiologists and public health experts has been deployed by the World Health Organization’s (WHO) Regional Office for Africa to assist the Government of Niger in the investigations, help plan response activities and support active searches for additional cases of paralytic polio.   This event confirms the risk of ongoing international spread of a pathogen (WPV) slated for eradication.  In May 2012, the completion of polio eradication was declared a programmatic emergency for global public health by the WHA in Resolution WHA65.5.  Given the history of international spread of polio from northern Nigeria across west Africa, WHO assesses the risk of further international spread from Nigeria as high.  Based on the history of previous importations to Niger and the ongoing response, WHO assesses the risk of further international spread from Niger as moderate to high.  This risk is currently magnified by large-scale population movements across the region associated with insecurity in Mali.  To minimize this risk, multi-country synchronized SIAs are planned across 13 countries of west Africa in late April and late May, using a combination of bivalent and trivalent OPV.   Due to the persistence of subnational surveillance gaps in some areas of west Africa, undetected further circulation cannot be ruled out at this time.  Investigations are ongoing to more clearly identify surveillance gaps in the region, including among mobile, migrant and underserved populations.  Measures are being implemented to strengthen sub-national surveillance, to ensure that all groups and areas, particularly high-risk populations, are covered by high-quality surveillance.   As per recommendations outlined in WHO's International travel and health, travellers to and from Niger, and other polio-affected countries, should be fully protected by vaccination.  It is important that all countries, in particular those with frequent travel and contacts with polio-infected countries, strengthen surveillance for cases of acute flaccid paralysis (AFP), in order to rapidly detect any new poliovirus importations and facilitate a rapid response.  Countries should also analyse routine immunization coverage data to identify any subnational gaps in population immunity to guide catch-up immunization activities and thereby minimize the consequences of any new virus introduction.  Priority should be given to areas at high-risk of importations and where OPV3/DPT3 coverage is  "

The case is a UK resident who developed symptoms of illness on 26 January 2013. Laboratory investigations on respiratory specimens have revealed both an Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 infection and a confirmed NCoV infection. He is hospitalized in intensive care unit.   Preliminary investigation reveals that the patient had a history of travel to Pakistan and Saudi Arabia.  Further investigation into the case is ongoing.   The Health Protection Agency (HPA) has instituted stringent infection control measures around the patient and identified contacts who may have been exposed to the patient during his illness.   This is a sporadic case and does not alter the current WHO risk assessment on NCoV but the new case does indicate that the virus is persistent. As of 11 February 2013, a total of 10  confirmed cases of human infection with a novel coronavirus have been notified to WHO.   Based on the current situation and available information, WHO encourages all Member States to continue their surveillance for severe acute respiratory infections (SARI) and to carefully review any unusual patterns. Testing for the new coronavirus of patients with unexplained pneumonias, or patients with severe, progressive or complicated illness not responding to treatment, should be considered especially in persons residing in or returning from the Arabian peninsula and neighboring countries.

"2013","http://www.who.int/csr/don/2013_02_11/en/index.html"," Poliovirus detected from environmental samples in Egypt   11 February 2013 -  In Egypt, wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) was isolated from sewage samples collected on 2 and 6 December 2012 in two areas of greater Cairo. Virus has been detected in sewage only; no case of paralytic polio has been reported.  Genetic sequencing shows that the virus strains are closely related to virus from northern Sindh, Pakistan.  Pakistan is one of three countries worldwide affected by ongoing indigenous transmission of WPV (together with Nigeria and Afghanistan). The isolates were detected through routine environmental surveillance in Egypt that involves regular testing of sewage water from multiple sites.   Following detection of these isolates, the Government of Egypt is implementing a comprehensive response in line with international outbreak response guidelines issued by the World Health Assembly (WHA) in Resolution WHA59.1. On 2-6 February, supplementary immunization activities (SIAs) were conducted in the two areas of Cairo from where the environmental samples had been collected, reaching more than 155,000 children with trivalent oral polio vaccine (OPV). In early March, SIAs are planned across Cairo to reach three million children with monovalent OPV type 1, to be followed in April by nationwide SIAs targeting 12 million children with trivalent OPV. A joint national and international team of epidemiologists and public health experts is assisting in the investigations, helping plan response activities and supporting active searches for any potential cases of paralytic polio.   This event confirms ongoing international spread of a pathogen (WPV) slated for eradication.  In May 2012, the completion of polio eradication was declared a programmatic emergency for global public health by the WHA in Resolution WHA65.5. Based on the history of previous importations to Egypt and the ongoing response, the World Health Organization (WHO) assesses the risk of further international spread of these virus strains from Egypt as moderate; and, of further international spread of WPV from Pakistan as high.  In 2011, WPV from Pakistan spread internationally to China, causing an outbreak in the country’s western Xinjiang province, resulting in 21 cases.   It is important that all countries, in particular those with frequent travel and contacts with polio-infected countries, strengthen surveillance for cases of acute flaccid paralysis (AFP), in order to rapidly detect any new poliovirus importations and facilitate a rapid response. Countries should also analyze routine immunization coverage data to identify any subnational gaps in population immunity to guide catch-up immunization activities and thereby minimize the consequences of any new virus introduction. Priority should be given to areas at high-risk of importations and where OPV3/DPT3 coverage is   Egypt stopped transmission of indigenous WPV, with its last case in May 2004. The environmental samples which yielded these positive results were collected in December 2012. Previous to this, the last environmental sample which had tested positive for WPV was related to virus from the Sudan, in December 2010.  "

Case details include an 8 month old male from Phnom Penh with onset 9 Jan 2013, a 17 year old female from Takeo Province with onset 11 January, a 35 year old male from Kong Pisey district, Kampong Speu Province with onset 13 January, a 17 month old female from Kong Pisey district, Kampong Speu Province with onset 13 January and a 9 year old female from Toeuk Chhou district, Kampot province with onset on 15 January 2013.   The cases all presented with fever, cough and other ILI symptoms. Four of the cases died, with 1 case, the 8 month old male, recovering after only experiencing mild ILI. Laboratory samples were tested by the National Institute of Public Health's laboratory and by the Institut Pasteur du Cambodge.   Preliminary evidence does not support human-to-human transmission and four of the cases are known to have had close contact with sick/dead poultry.   The Ministry of Health's Rapid Response Teams (RRT) have gone to the hospitals and the field to identify the patients’ close contacts, any epidemiological linkage among the five cases and initiate preventive treatment as required. In addition, public health education campaigns are being conducted in the villages to inform families on how to protect themselves from contracting avian influenza. The teams are checking records for evidence of increased ILI activity in the local health centres or any increase in number of SARI cases from the affected areas. Results from testing of those who have ILI symptoms among close contacts for A/H5N1 influenza to date were negative. There is enhanced surveillance for ILI and SARI in local health centre and hospital for a further two weeks. Health education messages have been distributed to the community. The World Health Organization is actively assisting the Ministry of Health in their investigations.  "
